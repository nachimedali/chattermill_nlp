story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it s singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly 
airport starts as a brand new luxury plane is loaded up with valuable paintings such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them a bunch of vip s to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid air the plane is hi jacked by the co pilot chambers robert foxworth his two accomplice s banker monte markham wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in having flown over miles off course the problems mount for the survivor s as they await help with time fast running out also known under the slightly different tile airport this second sequel to the smash hit disaster thriller airport was directed by jerry jameson while once again like it s predecessors i can t say airport is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid air hi jacking then the crashing didn t he see the oil rig sinking of the maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the floods or if any of the doors are opened it s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character s dull dialogue lethargic set pieces a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks there s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things don t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships helicopters flying about but there s just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background the home video theatrical version of airport run minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out character s longer rescue scenes the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren t great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that s a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isn t great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too airport is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production bland direction doesn t help though a film about a sunken plane just shouldn t be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde airport 
this film lacked something i couldn t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just don t know but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princess i was disappointed in this movie but don t forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself 
sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and i m no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed hours of this is well lying 
when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of s wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love non love halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them it s never about resolution it s only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience s ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if you re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise let s just pretend this film never happened 
 it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and let s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen s bergman pretensions allen s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i don t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspense horror films in robin wood s view it s a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that 
the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than years to make a swedish film the first being susan sontag s brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers i m afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don t like who i m becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don t know the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen s earlier films only he s directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from bergman s winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etc allen s later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining i ll take interiors woody s rarely made a funnier movie 
i don t know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasn t enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a year old woman and not angie harmon why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn t a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well 
this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise s marriage hopefully that effort produces better results 
the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i don t think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the s the subject was just not believable for the year even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didn t stay for the q a either i don t think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn t know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didn t get woody s carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about what was he thinking i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody s character car it didn t work it didn t even seem to make sense really the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it as for lauren lily and kristin boring don t see it it is painful unless you are a true harrelson fan 
this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when he s properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in d c who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldn t have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his r s in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages one of them being italian that s kind of a good reason to cast someone else don t ya think from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time 
the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe of the total movie time everything and i mean _everything_ in between is basically the director s desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i don t get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through minutes of hazy dark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesn t get naked not even in the nc version which i saw if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead you ll probably have more interesting dreams 
plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting nevertheless development is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed nothing shocking too much nothing overexciting movie sitcom style i liked woody excellent performance had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows 
this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men s wives i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes that s how slow it is the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom it s almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class it s sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing 
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful i just sat in utter amazement during this movie thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining the producers of this movie were very clever they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think woody harrison kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie boy are they in for a horrible time if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning
a worn out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case the equally worn out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behavior the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture a regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss 
i saw this movie at a drive in in until howard the duck i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have sired my mother the car maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it s time 
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical s teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell 
 ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there s a twist at the end there s nothing in this movie that you haven t seen in other movies but it s nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don t expect out of a bird the movie s pure hokum but harmless 
 ghost of dragstrip hollow appears to take place in a spotless netherworld an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who pressures her into a car race that s about it for the drag racing this b flick is mostly concerned with rock n roll man the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didn t mind an adult chaperone there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges necking kid we thought we d come out for some fresh air dad where did you think you d find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at minutes the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off screen and a pre scooby doo styled unmasking which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun from 
the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful it s a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil 
kareena kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm akshay kumar anil kapoor maybe saif kareena kapoor in a bikini good banner kareena kapoor in a bikini not one good reason not to see this movie or so i thought didnt these people make jbj why o why did i forget that for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn t that bad there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him saif is sidey ala main khiladi once again there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles and a few goosebumps during the kareena saif love story kareena in the rain behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm but mostly this half promises more than it delivers which makes the second half all the more unbearable there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to big for her body only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation anil kapoor and his sidekicks get on your nerves akshay kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while all the while you are subjected to one absurdity after the other why what when where what have i done to deserve this a collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half which were ordinary even without the movie around it cannot relieve the trauma anymore conclusion this movie starts of as a buzz which you feel could even turn out to a high but ends up slowly moving towards a headache and then rapidly turns into a full blown migraine attack please don t watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest s cast akshay kumar first half s what when how who to much confusion need a book to fill this s cast the whole second half need many pages to fill this total im trying to avoid the s and s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is 
i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments it s not a bad movie exactly but it s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters behavior often strains belief i d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don t have a lot of film tv literature life behind you to be honest i ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully and that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesn t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesn t really pay off 
vijay krishna acharya s tashan is a over hyped stylized product sure its a one of the most stylish films but when it comes to content even the masses will reject this one why the films script is as amateur as a year old baby script is king without a good script even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything tashan is produced by the most successful production banner yash raj films and mega stars appearing in it but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland thumbs down performances anil kapoor is a veteran actor but how could he okay a role like this akshay kumar is great actor in fact he s the sole saving grace kareena kapoor has never looked so hot she looks stunning and leaves you all stand up saif ali khan doesn t get his due in here sanjay mishra manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted tashan is a boring film the films failure at the box office should you keep away 
the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinking the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini the reason why i did not give a rating of is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong 
summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what s the hottest movie of the week given of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown i m hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasn t for tashan after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like it s literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesn t have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom both of which i enjoyed tremendously in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you can t fault his direction you d probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kong s wirework and hollywood s ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor who s not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmy s services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah beng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji s business so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumar s bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non green incredible hulk with his gravity defying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha male and played in ra ra mode each time he takes on adversaries but sad to say that s the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan pandey bachchan pandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasn t able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren t catchy at all usually the song dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach front tashan probably didn t take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharya s story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole 
shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can throw away crores on such stupidity shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to saif ali khan completely disappointed in your choice of film kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim wit anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last minutes it was enough to pop a blood vessel don t waste any brain cells energy or your money to go see this go see rent amu with konkana sensharma instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india intelligent poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making 
first lesson that some film makers particularly those inspired by hollywood need to know just style does not sell i guess tashan when translated will mean style second if you are hell bent on selling style that does not spare you from having a decent story tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director but it is not slick for example all three saif kareena and akshay are narrators at different points in the story but this setup is not utilized to properly there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations actions sequences are from the seventies cheoreography of the film is awful i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film vishal shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film why is there a sufi song dil haara in tashan why is the cool hinglish song dil dance maare not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film but he is in his stereotyped self you won t mind missing this film 
if this is a product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry yash raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear indicator of the director s vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil kapoor s gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie in short it s the biggest waste of resourses after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay s love story after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location probably ladakh in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car i am still thinking who wrote this if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both 
i had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif well i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom but if dhoom is compared to tashan i would say dhoom is very realistic when i saw the credits at the beginning i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way well the very first scene itself pis ed me off then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns phew you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early s movies well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this one and for that i give a rating of out of guys please please don t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes thats all 
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero 
i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss lakhan singh english the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh who is also known as bhaiyyaji but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji lakhan singh is a don in the meantime bhaiyyaji hires a man bachchan pandey to track down jimmy and pooja starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and akshaye kumar the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember now there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain lastly never mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression 
i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom and saif ali khan s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback after watching it i understood that why their wasn t a proper trailer because there wasn t anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a year old child can come up with a better story line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it s difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft unrealistic e g man with a handgun managed to kill about men with machine guns while i was watching tashan it reminded me of films sin city during the opening credits koyla anil kapoor s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny i also heard the budget is crores which is the same amount as dhoom and i don t know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times better the only good songs are dil haara challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil kapoor s terrible english couldn t save this discomfiture 
i don t want to go too far into detail because i can t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring pointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci fi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything i wasn t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didn t achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kino s journey instead 
tashan the title itself explains the nature of the movie this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c grade movies or even some c grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box office which it certainly deserved in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif s hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hit akshay s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself don t think so instead she became slim yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saif s son ibrahim appears in the beginning last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of years before going into practical directions sorry i don t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies 
i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareena s beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi final but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion can t they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabh s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please don t make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic 
the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i don t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemen s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crap i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement i strongly recommend not to see this movie 
i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinema s signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future i m sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time 
if there is one film which is the worst of this year it s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom and what i expected first saif s introduction which is boring then saif kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film what kinda role it is what acting is he doing his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke vijay krishna acharya would have got films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinary performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay
absolutely awful movie utter waste of time background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligible camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this 
sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attack such amazing songs in promo dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss music wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these jokers and they haven t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandey overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english go away man i need to puke 
i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasn t good great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films overall i was totally disappointed with the movie 
the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh that was one in many goof ups of the movie anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and don t blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them 
this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to greece anyway as for saif you d expect a great performance but even he let down the people akshay kumar recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs he was sensational in this movie for only this performance filmfare should introduce another award the toiletries award for the worst performance by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing bikini s and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife to be dress like that but she must ve impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked it i am forced to give it a but i d really give this movie a an unachieved film 
ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humor good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost in translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast paced speaking and absurd action however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo jumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut out hysterical characters scene i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe 
 for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c p must now be compared first off the beginning did have elements of style and if handled well could have become a cult classic a la pulp fiction or a desi desperado but the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses it throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trail good ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director sir what were you smoking im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music watch the videos hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy as i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshay s bullet wound vanish in a microsecond what were you editors doing tashan maybe 
the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan the mega disappointing mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film it s a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they ve got big movie stars onboard written and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what you d describe as a road movie but one that s going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call centre executive who s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji that s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmy s got his eye on pooja the gangster s pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangster s faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that s hidden across the length and breadth of the country much like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatment s so over the top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeena s bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno style horse driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because you re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making what s more i don t think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stew there are films that kill you softly and then there s tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn t hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn t help either because they don t blend with the film s wafer thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoor s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over the top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent it s thanks to akshay kumar s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when he s cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he s up there despite some good music from vishal shekhar the songs seem like they re only prolonging your misery well that s because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didn t know tashan means style i m sorry to say this film has none 
such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors they ve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don t think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts they ve used akki akshay kumar very well but could ve been done much much better animation is the worst i ve seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lake and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences don t forget the movie name i guess 
i would have liked to write about the story but there wasn t any i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like minutes after that its overkill i would have liked to swoon over the keep u guessing suspense but it was as predictable as um mm a yash raj movie i would have liked to talk of the edge of the seat action but i don t like cartoons much sigh all in all this movie is perfect for people attempting suicide i promise it ll push you over the edge sado masochists this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da vinci code wore people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone movie piraters more power to them if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch this is it barnacles most types of plankton green algae because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers afterthought the director of the movie obviously is a species of his own and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind one is enough things that could have made this a better movie a story a choreographer a screenplay writer a stunt coordinator a story did i already say that a director preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job anil kapoor bubonic plague avoid at all costs a statutory warning watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health things i liked about the movie kareena kapoor for obvious reasons the english sub titles mera dil kho gaya becomes my heart is in a void chaliya chaliya chaliya turns into im a flirt im a lover im a vagabond priceless in short tashan to me is like the opposite of a rubrics cube the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player tashan promises to lower your iq and that in a mere hours woot sigh but thats just me i could be wrong you ve been warned anyways 
this is the biggest flop of i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it 
all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure but this is not the case vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor she was unbearable throughout the film her tom boy look does not really goes well even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
i wasn t terribly impressed with dante s st season offering in homecoming it wasn t much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate 
i ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes and this is among the worst an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you let s check out the basement then this is your show except it s not amusing or entertaining it s just annoying the extent of the virus is never ever showed i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands the woman flees north and runs into a few tens situations then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her things that make you go huh or something then she is huddling for warmth the end awful these directors are mailing this tripe in 
masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god scientist alan jasn priestley is brought in by the government knows more than most senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne kerry norton to take their teenage daughter amy brenna o brien try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them this canadian american co production was episode from season of the masters of horrror tv series directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks it takes itself far too seriously i don t really understand why it s part of the masters of horror series the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself themes ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it s gets the chance during it s short odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up i wasn t happy with the inconsistencies with the story either if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman s neck on the plane was he sexually aroused i think not why does every bloke then think he s killing in the name of god i just can t see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible starting to believe in god i just found the notion ridiculous the show also states clearly that there s nothing religious about what s going on so what s the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see then there s the fact people get turned on by different things what about gays for instance will they kill guys instead of women i know there s a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it s conveniently brushed to one side then there s the thing which annoyed me the most the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened it just felt so stupid the plotting is rubbish to round things off there s a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x files with a bright neon alien director dante on this showing definitely doesn t qualify as a master of horror as far a i m concerned the story is badly paced it s just so stupid considering it s played deadly straight instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it s deadly virus on the loose situation the subsequent mother daughter on the run because of it there s very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror even less gore there s a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about technically like the other episodes it s really good it doesn t have the look of a cheap tv series the special effects are great as usual it s well made the acting is alright but no one really stood out the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i ve seen but bear in mind i haven t seen all of them yet as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me as a show made by a so called master of horror it disappoints me even more 
i love the frequently misnomered masters of horror series horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment projects like this and the similar greenlight project with gave us feast like it or lump it are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror this one began with a kernel of really kool idea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am i going with this i don t know how to spoil the spoiled but spoiler ahead all of a sudden no there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier we have long haired luminescent aliens huh huh brain drilling males and yeah i get it but well the worst curse of storytelling a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement cue to storytellers your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up not the other way around storytelling math end of spoilers big oops

a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante their previous collaboration on the first season s homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered the supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of it s human infestation why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king s the stand instead of having the male population butcher the females i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it i like a lot of both dante and hamm s work but this was just unwatchable 
i gave this stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction it s bleak depressing and hopeless while i don t mind a less than cheery ending i m really very tired of the humans suck clich that s central to every movie i know you can t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race but how s bout as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired this way you won t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive it s silly not thoughtful and boring 
warner bros made many potboilers in the s and most of them are fast paced economical and very entertaining i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life this is one of warner s few hard edged melodramas that simply doesn t work edward g robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don t cut the mustard h b warner aline macmahon and boris karloff are good but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie in addition the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre code hollywood leroy s direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations sol polito s camera work is strong somehow this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture in a year that gave us m dracula and frankenstein 
a little girl s dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other it is assumed to be the body of a couple s missing daughter after this trauma the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence all of this changes when one day many years later she receives a phone call from her daughter with the help of an ex cop and a reporter she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive los sin nombre is a mess plot wise moves at an achingly slow pace and is completely unscary the saving grace is emma vilarasau who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother the best part of the movie is the ending but i m not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film beware of the english subtitles on the recent r release they aren t very accurate 
i m not alone in admiring the first superman movie a film that richard donner executed masterfully i am also not alone in scorning richard lester s superman which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie sadly it is still an absolute abomination superman s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses but superman stretches things too far it doesn t matter who directed superman because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman with or without his powers superman s strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner there is too much to criticize so i will not bother i condemn this movie perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on super duper bad 
i grew up on the superman ii theatrical version s t and as a kid i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman type villains it started off with a bang the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen as in part i now as an adult i can see how the mighty had fallen with s t see my review i ve always heard of the back story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original s director richard donner from part ii it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now it s common back to the future and matrix for example unfortunately after finally seeing the richard donner cut or s rd i still can t fully recommend it gone was the great superman change scene the entire paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part i in s t s opening in fact they all but wrote the words previously on superman in s rd the special effects weren t great in either part i or s t but s rd they were mostly downright laughable such as lois falling from the daily planet window i will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite overall if you grew up on s t as i did and loved it as a child not nitpicking as i do as an adult you should absolutely see s rd as it s almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes spoiler alert unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s t replaced with the exact same ending as i this is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesn t make sense on why clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened and will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation 
so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that let s listen to donner make fun of lester s version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd superman s freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark s earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack n j ever went since it doesn t free zod and company any more 
superman ii the richard donner cut should be a fan s dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn t convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you ll believe a man can fly it s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn t make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn t get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that s neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper s back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it s just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester s footage but probably had too much pride to admit that the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk while we all know it s the xk a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner s didn t make this a separate release here in the states as it is we re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester s version it s by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history 
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished i am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community 
i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family and this went on and on if mr mcelwee s family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco related diseases i grew up near the area where mr mcelwee s family began it tobacco business i expected more than mcewee s continual focus on his family i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco the countless references to the movie bright leaves are out of place so what if gary cooper played mr mcelwee s great grandfather does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film i didn t 
when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don t care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this 
the author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the completely and deservedly forgotten movie bright leaf is about an ancestor of his its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self indulgent glorified home movie suitable for screening at the director s drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial or even non commercial release a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his her immediate circles avoid at all costs 
 the curse of frankenstein sticks faithfully to mary shelley s story for one word of the title which wouldn t be so bad if the changes were any good at all the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein s family has been completely excised and replaced with nothing the heart and moral centre of the story is gone it doesn t help that this frankenstein is a conniving devious murderer he deserves everything he gets the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clich s even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a shite looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut as it s the first of hammer s horror films directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee its place in horror history is secure but it s crap 
nintendo you ers how could you do this to me i can t believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along oh god where do i even begin the plot sucked the voice acting sucked the animation sucked the ending really sucked if you liked this movie you suck too and to futuramafan who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a tool plain and simple this isn t a movie for anyone but crack addled ten year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god i m still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie and then there was pikachu s adventure don t even get me started on that horrible mess of a film it is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life don t go watch this at any costs bottom line go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it burn them all and then proceed to rent a good movie like aliens or bowling for columbine or even back to the future 
now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have wow some demented pok mon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pok mon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film it is just an animation it should be on video ps i ll give it a because i just got bucks i could not give it a half because there s no halves 
pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesn t have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn t worth renting and the short movie before didn t do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans oh well maybe the next one will be better cant ge t much worse
much worse than the original it was actually painful to sit through and it barely held my six year old s interest introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting but storyline is extra thin dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre watch the television show instead it s much better 
i recently watched this again and there s another version which is shorter i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice prof ivy was rather boring she sounded as if she was almost asleep no expression at all with the few lines she had this was enjoyable enough but there wasn t much to it at all a collector whos after lugia he has no plan to destroy the world and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better deoxys poke is great with no almost here 
i figured that it s about time i let this one out pok mon fans are suffering in america these days why because we rely on kids wb and kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now i have seen all three pok mon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing pok mon in theaters i can t help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says `insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb extreme sarcasm there and created this crap possible spoilers from here on well i guess i should first talk about pikachu s rescue adventure my first gripe with this came with no narration i guess they got enough bad comments on the pok dex narration that plagued pikachu s vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman s voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration all together this wouldn t have been a problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn t let togepi go until the end possibly the fans but i m sure not the parents then there s the theme song i couldn t help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was `tankentai wo tsukurou and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana nice music fun to watch that s changed with the bellossom the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the pok mon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary oh and then there s the poliwhirl who thinks he s a poliwrath you d think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but i haven t touched on the worst of it yet you d think that the warning signs would ve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power for some unfathomable reason i had been placing some faith in kids and the wb my thoughts were `well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well that in mind i just didn t pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said `you will believe that one person can make all the difference with the way they said that at every turn i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version then comes nintendo power in which i see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature the power of one at that point i became a bit more uneasy `the power of one not a good sign however i still kept some of my false faith big mistake sitting in the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle i can see a point in that since they didn t pander this thing repeating it over and over like in msb however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to ash ah hah so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of arshia needed a pok mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony this time he s the chosen one a greater way that this did damage was to lugia lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pok mon movie when the movie was about lugia in this one lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash in the scene where they re flying back to the main island lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia s existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasn t really the `one person that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking furura s flute song wasn t nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one jirarudan s speech to them saying his collection `started with a mew card ugh even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held `why didn t you put them in pok balls when you caught them this is like caging them to be displayed much different from whining about him thinking pok mon are things to be collected like stamps if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american pok mon movie i m going to see i ve imported the third one and find it very enjoyable i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two i ll be importing the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and kids you have forsaken me for the last time 
a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief s daughter leading to much hate and violence this crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it s press materials pretends it to be in short the plentiful nudity the real reason for watching this is good everything else is not there s definitely better examples of both genres more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch and features not one but two members of the manson family catherine share and bobby beausoleil who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda stained screens of the pussycat theater 
this is an awful film yea the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn t get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i won t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward i like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i don t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film i need not watch this again of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives 
ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who i ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven t hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoiler not the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who s crooked dead and the hero prevails they got flame throwers and rocket launchers really no kidding bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die trying now the special thing about that movie is that its got year old men playing or even younger teens i could go on with these 
roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look alike gambler man clint burns george gabby hayes is mr rogers s ex pal sheriff gabby gale storm jane fillmore and sally payne polly morgan are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero of course mistaken identity impersonation is a plot development since rogers essays a dual role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll hyde performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms paye as the st louis journal reporters they are the film s highlight the songs are fine though badly synched jesse james at bay joseph kane roy rogers george gabby hayes gale storm
i saw this film at its premier at sundance since american beauty is a movie that had something to say i had hopes for towelhead unfortunately it was a disappointment in fact of countless movies i ve seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals towelhead is the only sundance movie i ve ever wanted to walk out early from the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes rather than with an organic human drama the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author s political views that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic if there ever was a time when towelhead s white male villains condescending portrayals of blacks ironic treatments of foreign cultures etc were fresh it s long past for a more detailed review please look up any of the many professional reviews available online almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on on the other hand the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites you ll frequently come across superlatives stunning breathtaking profound shocking it embarrasses me to read them but it does not surprise me indeed i ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial cultural gender or sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full of profound insight if you are such a person by all means rent towelhead and be moved by it on the other hand if you set your standards higher you can safely pass on this one 
unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie my points film is based on things ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning or things about the asian culture but unfortunately it is not enough knowing kunefe and names of other foods doesn t make a person understand a culture for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that lebanese people are christian ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don t make ethnocentrism so we don t judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this show me girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre please watch dr strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it where is the truth where is the meaning about the movie 
hollywood s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american graffiti s stayin alives and grease s while the original grease is not a great film the adaptation of the long running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the s energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster fortunately for moviegoers michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts her talent and beauty were already evident herein and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform maxwell caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic what romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve arden connie stevens and sid caesar have any wit although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material reviewers have complained that because grease is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early s and the only nostalgia evoked is for our miss brooks and sid caesar s comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters unfortunately grease is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewer s attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage 
the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here it s michael i prefer to watch the first grease 
i m sorry but even tj hooker s adrian zmed couldn t save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington i d hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopeds i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunky australian boy can t fit into outsiders dominated school ergo goes for tough guy with stupid biker helmet look it was disney story gone horribly awry so it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it 
the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia newton st john s foreign speech pattern is not explained it s explained here caulfield is her cousin what s conn still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she s a beautician caulfield s a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd and that s especially bad when zmed s girl friend decides she likes caulfield but being a nerd just isn t going to cut it that s when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards caulfield won t have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he s outfitted grease introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out in addition to conn eve arden sid caesar and dody goodman all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles the music score isn t remotely as good as the songs that come from the original it s not that grease is bad it s just not all that great 
well at least my theater group did lol so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it s still a lot of fun to watch i heard horrible things about grease and that s why i decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasn t all that bad and my friend agreed so i decided to give it a shot but i called them up and just laughed first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn t really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors tell me how did the pink ladies and t birds continue years on after the former gangs left not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t birds were just stupid and ridiculous another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn t stopped but when a new student who is sandy s cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady stephanie but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t birds so the new student decides to train as a t bird to win her heart so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t bird s butts but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own well find out for yourself grease is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn t work the gang didn t click as well as the first grease did not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because i thought that she graduated from rydell but apparently she didn t the songs were not really that catchy i m glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast but that s probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel i wouldn t really recommend this film other than if you are curious but i warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical 
boy girl love affair sequel with songs only this time she s the punkette and he s the straight arrow movie buffs out there actually like this movie it has fans i must say the mind reels grease is a truly lame enterprise that doesn t even have the courage moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames like jaws or exorcist ii no it whimpers along in slow motion and often just plays dead it looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and although she doesn t embarrass herself it s a role worth forgetting a misfire on the lowest of levels no stars from 
when i was grease was like crack it was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience my sister and i would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another so if you are an year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass if however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution and or consumption for the sake of criticism i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows in a well executed musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters in grease with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way score tonight reproduction do it for our country and prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the film s characters or themes plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance the t birds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussy dufus loser in the end when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t bird jacket and initiates him into the gang michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it but of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the t birds since michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slack jawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat so aside from being pretty i guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael s attraction to her i could go on and on but i didn t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair i will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time s sake grease is an experience akin to re living your first kiss only you are now and kissing a snot nosed year old kid with acne and slobby braces the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed trust me 
i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial minutes of the film i managed to stomach minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great fun the story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and timberlake s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something which simply isn t evident at all apart from the fact that though freeman s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion don t watch this film it is a pure waste of time 
i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love it s not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime everything s pretty restrained and you don t really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasn t able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess i m not the target audience for this but i m not sure who is everything s muted and soft focus and earth tones nothing s very interesting i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it s handled so discreetly that i was disappointed rent personal best instead 
i ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing it s so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in cliche ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesn t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull it s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true to life gusto or didn t have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard issue bad lifetime tv movie 
i laughed all the way through this rotten movie it s so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep they re lesbians nothing rings true in this lifetime for women with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i don t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn t take it doesn t help there s a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter s new relationship a sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year a film gets made in which there s a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids sheesh no cliche is left unturned 
they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love the only thing worse is the film itself the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital at one point when the wife leaves the husband a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack no kidding the actors try but are defeated by the inept unbelievably terrible script direction is staggeringly bad no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation how do things like this get made i m turning off the television before it s over 
this movie was okay but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman it almost seems as if kate s gender preferences turned on and off like a switch making this film seem a little simplistic also as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots and there was no happy medium it was either kate s friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her this is not typical of interactions between gay and non gay relatives and friends it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make sadly the movie showed none of these types of interactions for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance it struck me as very intolerant movie then at the end kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory is that what being gay is really all about come on 
why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles an unexpected love ooh how provocative this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don t really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion you might enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn t really get out in the world to observe people why am i wasting my time writing about it 
i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager but i wanted to see it again because traci lords is now earning a living as a serious actor what the hell was going on in the eighties this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors definitely a waste of money 
this is probably the first entry in the lance o leary nurse keat detective series in subsequent o leary films he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee a group of relatives all played by well known character actors gathers in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders a creepy film worth seeing 
i am an actor producer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i don t think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you were you smoking crack i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history 
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designer s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct on a cardboard wall since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her don t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommel s logic and enjoy the absurd ride after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack we re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty unlike other zombies lommel s girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is i won t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist 
the plot of edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire f r a t squad whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it do not waste your time watching this film don t even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choice and justin if you re reading this stick to music even though you re no good at that you ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing 
this movie is a joke i mean a ha ha funny joke why because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting wow within this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how why are there four black women who are zombie s caretakers and what is their purpose since when does people make up a nation of zombies and is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone anywhere even a year old and lastly why was this movie made at all why why why no answer that s what i thought on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance lol at least they had the decency to do this much 
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained 
seriously crappy movie first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse furniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouse s attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesn t think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for now the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffel bagged body since she had the oogey boogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others don t even notice massive plot hole so to wrap it up the eye shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part of this cow dropping 
i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don t be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed the description on the back of the box doesn t even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i ve lost all faith in humanity and don t even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in locations or that the cops didn t even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans 
mt little sister and i are self proclaimed horror movie buffs we have seen just about everything especially zombie flicks now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie make up was the worst i have seen if you can even call it make up black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it s cover cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying this movie sucks don t waste your time return now hahahhaa i don t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie i don t even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
someone actually gave this movie stars there s a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn t spend seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary this film is well i guess it s pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting plot story sets dialogue and sound i wrongly assumed it was about zombies watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you re terrified someone will come over and you ll never be able to describe what it is and they ll go away thinking you re a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines i m so taken aback i m writing this review on my mobile so i don t forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered i worst film i ve ever seen and i can say with hand on heart it will never never be topped 
this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title zombie nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy s music when the zombies attack the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy 
i stopped by bb and picked up zombie flicks to watch over the weekend now i understand that the effects will be cheesy the acting will be sub par and the sets will be suspect so i m not expecting much but it should at least have a story stories don t cost a thing except time apparently they didn t have any time either zombie nation had zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre the running time is only minutes but it felt like hours according to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie porn which if you think about sounds kinda gross but it wasn t even that good the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off i rated it a out of because imdb won t allow me to use decimals 
not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts makeup that a child can do acting was over done poor directing editing was very choppy many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous sound was badly dubbed music was highly inappropriate casting was extremely off must have been on crack zombies that talk let alone drive dance work just pisses me off and the bad guy holy crap as horribly casted as he was he was the best looking zombie of all which doesn t say much the cover art was good but very deceiving as was the main menu of the dvd great artwork and music don t bother 
thank god i didn t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life f g visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the director s ulli lommel profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between and and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie 
 review may contain some spoilers i ll make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well it s pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison s police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called f r a t first response assault tactics he s teamed with an on the edge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i don t want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the f r a t team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey s performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfying don t waste your time with this film i m putting it on ebay this weekend 
ok its not the best film i ve ever seen but at the same time i ve been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it 
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant i tend to support everybody because their efforts are worth but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits imagine the following situation think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far think about some great attractive art for that movie s dvd box and a promising plot voil you got zombie nation see it only if you really don t have anything else better to do anything is better 
notice i have given this star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it didn t prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terrible please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch in the end i m not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it 
if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it s this pile of crap i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it s so insultingly poor i can t believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable there s no plot and the non plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking the people don t react act or in any way resemble human beings the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be the whole thing is one pointless mess it doesn t go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don t do very much i could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before it s pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time honestly the very worst movie of all time you ll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a and urge you to buy the dvd i can t imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film it s terrible and that s generous 
this movie had me going the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors band together and plan to take out the zombies dead wrong it s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation first off the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face what are zombies but mindless debatable intelligent cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies sure the eating and killing is there but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre it makes fun of that genre and asks the question why can t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much it s an insult and as for scary not even 
i only watched the first minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet this cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn t sure if that is what s happening because he s a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cop s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn t know what is happening the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at minutes because i couldn t take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won t waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless 
zombie nation r hey i was bored i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesn t warn me not to watch this film i could ve used that advice zombie nation is just like troll in that it s completely misnamed it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them yup he s a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that it s a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison he doesn t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it talk about boring eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they re all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh yay this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier make up effects the women don t look zombie like unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they re obviously filming in you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear it s a waste of time 
yeah i m sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it i m a big fan of the george romero movies and i m pretty sure that if he saw this movie he d probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie s devils it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldn t even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn t help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater or if you just like reaming on bad c movies c for craptastic then this is the movie for you or not 
last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the dead boy was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover art which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i couldn t suspend my disbelief anymore some people actually consider this a so bad it s good movie they are liars i didn t finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through this is even worse than zombiez do not watch 
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designer s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct on a cardboard wall since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her don t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommel s logic and enjoy the absurd ride after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack we re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty unlike other zombies lommel s girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is i won t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist 
btk killer green river killer zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is he loves his crap i ve never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful like the movies i said in the beginning don t even equal a six when added together after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is he is the worst out there the credits wouldn t end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots the editing is easily the worst this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn t take it anymore as it wouldn t end and i was only minutes in the movie i couldn t take it anymore i wasted minutes of my life do not watch this crap 
i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it so it seemed promising and it was until justin timberlake came on scene he is a really bad actor and shouldn t be allowed to make a movie ever again i mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors i ve ever seen he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack i think matt damon would have been a better choice kevin spacey was another big disappointment his character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se en it might sound cool but believe me it s not now dylan mcdermott s acting is very good it s about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspired morgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines though about the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when lazerov dylan mcdermott was killed but nothing really happened 
this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i m not even kidding it was poorly made and the actors couldn t act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost minutes of the movie which watching the credits was the best part of the movie this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn t believe how badly it was put together scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen s joking around making a fake fight scene if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show s how awful it truly is i wish i would have watched it before i rented it 
horrible acting bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg i have never seen a worse movie in my life minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen it didn t aside from a nice breast shot the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least of the sets you even see this same red chair in several different locations if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actor s dialog note to producers renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee you will be demanding your money back i only spent to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off 
every year i watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight to dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see i have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable horror films i have ever seen in fact i still haven t recovered from the experience of watching it the day after it seems like some kind of weird dream did i really see what i thought i saw why do the police work out of a warehouse did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the zombies eat cheeseburgers is it safe is it safe is it safe i wouldn t recommend zombie nation if you want to see a good film and neither would i recommend it as so bad its good however if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever this is for you now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is i will say zombie nation seriously i think it s a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude he really is the ed wood jr of the digital age and i for one can t wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one 
i ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and it s women with raccoon masks on zero special effects and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic however i can t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again 
this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back do not watch this movie even if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned 
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising it s not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me i ve done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyes i m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie s main character is an l a cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent it s beyond insulting 
i honestly want the last minuets of my life back the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes they talked like regular people one drove a car some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to dance that was it out came the movie i couldn t take it any longer can i sue for a hour of my life 
wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it on this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didn t know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide don t do it it s not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie don t do it 
acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york s social set oh yes don t forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder the all star cast features barbara stanwyck van heflin james mason ava gardner cyd charisse and nancy davis 
the animation in this re imagining of peter the wolf is excellent but at minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter the snails because everything moves at a snail s pace i couldn t even watch the film in one sitting i had to watch it minutes at a time and it was pure torture save yourself minutes do not watch this film and you will thank me i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that there s no way this film will come close to winning 
ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and he s the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know it s one of two things an indie or a dog as in sat on a shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming 
this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence however after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence however out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everything and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life what an odd silly and preachy film personally i d like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting 
bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry as fred and emily hill receive an advance on an inheritance they use the money go traveling their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann for mr kendall and lonely percy marmont for ms barry but they remain as boring as they were before arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well titled as quoted in the film from shakespeare s the tempest rich and strange by ordering up some camera trickery an opening homage to king vidor s the crowd is the highlight the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat rich and strange alfred hitchcock henry kendall joan barry percy marmont elsie randolph
yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation as with juno and the paycock you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie there is almost no style or craft to it at all the story revolves around fred and emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband this might seem more believable if fred weren t made out to be a completely insensitive pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman the couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene the third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband that s about all you can say for this one 
i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together the talk is not of the master s great films like north by northwest or strangers on a train but a lesser known effort like this one from obscure and seriously flawed which showcases the great director in fledgling form emily and fred hill joan barry and harry kendall are a middle class london couple scrimping to stay ahead he begrudges their lot she accepts it change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury they make plans for a world cruise but their problems have only begun just ask richard hannay roger o thornhill or marion crane well marion s indisposed at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight setting one up for a perilous journey at best this is perhaps hitchcock s earliest foray into this theme and not his most successful or memorable hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element in this case domestic drama rather than suspense but the two do not cohere at least not here the hills are a dull flat couple with no chemistry or personality when they find themselves at the folies berg re in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers the curtain s gone up too soon gasps emily they aren t dressed when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing even if the people they partner off with are drips too emily s man gordon percy marmont carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs which he suggests be filled by emily fred s girl the princess betty amann has clara bow s eyes and wallace beery s five o clock shadow there s also an obnoxious fellow passenger a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue subtlety was still to come everything is shot in an abrupt manner with confusing blocking and strained dialogue hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn t come off and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears when fred and emily break off they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged together rickshaws one of many clunky attempts at symbolism emily s the only vaguely sympathetic character in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon but mostly because she s among the first of hitchcock s many magnetic blondes her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film s conclusion matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with and presumably repair their relationship only they aren t active participants in the resolution and except for the fate of a friendly cat nothing about the ending resonates at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early s and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food rich and strange is hitchcock paying his dues and learning his trade one for scholars but not casual film goers 
there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can t see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the s version or the s versions or even batman begins just anything over this version 
 this would have been what you got words alone cannot describe how bad this is if you re having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you ll be out in fifteen minutes robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the s but he s phoning it in here in an interview johnny duncan robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder in fact he s more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al s used car lot at below sticker price the dynamic duo don t put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it s bruce wayne s car they re driving in fact it s noted by several characters throughout the serial the acting is wooden the sets are cheap the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i m sure it read along the lines of batman says something here because it certainly seems like they re making it up as it goes along batman s utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts never to be seen again his cowl is so bad he can t even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike in one scene i am not making this up batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods it s radioactive so he can trace it the reason it s so highly flammable isn t explained well unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse we know it s a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out and soon the whole place burns to the ground thanks batman in another scene after the batmobile is disabled batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one yes you guessed it said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce s house or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood everything about this serial is bad and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen if you re looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark if you want entertainment try the burton batman films the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial 
granting the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor batman the producer sam katzman was known as king of the quickies and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles robin rescues batman batman vs wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks batman s cowl with its devil s horns and eagle s beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes his utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments in any case the lead players are miscast robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that he d rather be somewhere anywhere else john duncan as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him out of costume lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the serial although serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster are simply annoying even the established comic book regulars are superfluous it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne despite the perils she faces vicki displays virtually no emotion commissioner gordon is none too bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is mr wayne s residence they are props for a drawn out gimmick laden incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet pity that the filmmakers couldn t invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all chapters of batman and robin combined now for the good news this is not the version 
this show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from british society as a whole it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there were are no class divisions in britain they d always say things like go into your loft and you may find this or go into your back garden tonight and what about us scummy working class kids who never never had a loft and a back garden which was nothing more than a meter square of balcony on the th floor of a council block public service broadcasting yeah right and on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class up their own backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having fun do me a favour and why don t you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on mama and papa s money you make me sick
he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero s acting and the hole thing was i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making th rate films with th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a million dollar budget segal being paid of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie 
i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say i d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f through them the script was so poor if i found out that a year old wrote it i shouldn t be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldn t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can t imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life 
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up with enough cops to run a mini war that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying thanks to a corrupt cop you will never get your ish minutes back life is too precious to rent this movie i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie if you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie 
i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made the only highlight of this film and only reason i gave it stars instead of is that a it is seagal and b seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife next time give me minutes of seagal killing people and don t even bother with a story line because the storyline not only stunk but so did the acting the fact that f s and f s somehow changed into f s and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f also the stealth never had to refuel and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point last i checked afghanistan has no air force we usa control the skies also this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top please tell us why they jailed him since when are air force pilots great commandos unless they are owen wilson and since when are their drunks in arab countries considering muslims don t drink alcohol also on top of that since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the in charge the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store and the other people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere 
well i can once and for all put an end to the question what is the worst movie ever made ever it is flight of fury starring and co written by steven seagal sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously it is a romanian made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again it was released only on video i can t imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd s had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling 
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other a renegade pilot steve touissant steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it so they are forced to send in their best man john sands seagal who else to stop him in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he s learned over the years i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man by the same director wasn t bad and what the hell seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe just maybe he could make a great film again oh what a fool i was dubbing horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets awful camera work cheap production values risible unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal s trademark and a boring sleep inducing plot that doesn t go anywhere thankfully his next film once upon a time in the hood which i ll be skipping apparently marks the end of his contract with sony meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres hell he s done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him rocky balboa this isn t a flight of fury it isn t even a flight of fun it s a flight that fails to even take off the ground 
unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under minutes the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherent the acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in porno s ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly cringe worthy special effects wouldn t look out of place in a s sword and sorcery flick unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures don t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back 
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people in self defence he s active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich evil english villain that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn t interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the lesbian interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn t even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn t need to in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse save minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagal s most ardent fan 
i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for million now a days those things cost about billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didn t mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane 
nobody could like this movie for its merit but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst quality then this is for you it ranks up there with road house for its preposterous characters sets and story line the bad writing really cracked me up i want you to dust those guys off instead of dust those guys f s take off from the carrier but when they get into formation they re f s without a hint of anger or skepticism segal goes back to work for the general who only minutes before was overseeing a covert mind wipe on seagal segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards so naturally the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling then segal flies it back to california the long way i e by way of europe even though there s a carrier giving him air support minutes away in the arabian sea the cic in the carrier consists of black pcs flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls what a hoot 
first of all f is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft secondly the f s and f s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers thirdly the f has only one m cannon not two last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f s and f s being mysteriously transformed into f s this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f when students hand in really bad work teachers assign s now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive out of 
over the years i ve seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege and executive decision at least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications on the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter i honestly believe that more of segal s movies would do better if he wasn t the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results 
you ve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolie s and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling and if it seems like i m spending a little too much time talking about them it s because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that it s hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he can t even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesn t fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking 
if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake 
this movie should have never been made what a shame of the budget please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie definitely not worth watching they keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re running or times it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie making his movies are getting worser every time black dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse 
steven seagal mr personality himself this time is the united states greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor jannick mark bazeley john sands seagal will fly into enemy territory receiving help from his arab lover jessica ciera payton and a freedom fighter rojar alki david once they are on ground jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders stone vincenzo nicoli and his female enforcer eliana katie jones and sands must figure out how to not only re take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well and maybe sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained rather steve toussaint in the process sands has hours until a general s navy pilots bomb the entire area on board the stealth black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb hoping to detonate it on the united states seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn t slicing their throats with knives the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead the setting of afghanistan doesn t hold up to scrutiny nor does how easily seagal and co are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about the movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky seagal isn t as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes unlike the good old days one of seagal s poorest efforts and he s as understated as ever not a compliment even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film s chief villains tis a shame he doesn t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but it s not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close ups 
flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job everything goes well until the x disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x to fly into us airspace undetected drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane sends in one man army john sands co writer executive producer steven seagal to get it back kill all the bad guy s in the process this american british romanian co production was directed by michael keusch was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man attack force luckily someone decided the partnership wasn t working an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration s between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of black thunder starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character s even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days it s boring even though it s not that slow the character s are poor it s full of clich s things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent it s a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame there s no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes it s right down there with the worst seagal has made flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn t even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky the quality of film changes very abruptly as it s all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited it s hard to tell who is who of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap shoddy the imdb reckons this had a budget of about which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect seagal looks dubbed again flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more 
flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i ve ever seen up to now it s a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isn t really trying in this he s fat and his voice is dubbed once more the co stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of rd raters the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he s also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers shadow man attack force the screenplay co written by seagal himself is laughably inept according to imdb m was spent on this boring load of old tosh if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder which has to be better than this tripe this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever give it a miss out of 
as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel his best was just fodder for bored teenagers this one tips the scales then falls off the characters are all cardboard the story is double lame i can t spoil it by telling you the ending you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one here goes he is a super dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide instead of killing him to dope his brain until he don t remember squat he escapes of course gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who surprise surprise segal trained all the heroes except segal s character and his dusky girlfriend die heroically and steve baby save the whole world in one swell foop or fell swoop whatever made with some surplus air force and navy flying film and a lot of boom booms get some popeye cartoons instead 
steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources to pick on the technical flaws silver f a s and f s take of from a carrier for an air strike and miraculously become camouflaged f s for the actual strike would give this movie more credibility than it deserves suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu 
 flight of fury is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film i don t expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesn t even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of rd raters i find it hard to believe that anything close to m was spent on this dire mess unless m of that was seagal s salary i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that it s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i ve endured 
i usually don t comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i _have_ to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f and other hi tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fiction it s one of the worst movies i have ever seen simply don t bother and one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site points and i give this movie a try now i m wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than points 
following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to out stink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie career s decline where attack force was a hodge podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a high tech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in hrs seagal has to get the plane back it s that simple no annoying sub plots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works that s not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though it s pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for example in filmic terms fof is bad it s badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost he s just got the look of a toddler who s been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so un ambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studio s multi picture deal the producers can t be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a or so million dollar budget and after seagal s obligatory million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining million then i m elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that s already got distribution sorted before it s made fan s though may argue he at least owes them the effort he s seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dub overs is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team there s nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again there s a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we don t want to see overall the action isn t too bad it s nice and violent and on occasion we re treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and re appears after with little explanation there s far too much stock footage used using stock shots isn t an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is we re treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changing the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but that s not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this one s existence 
i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making th rate films with th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a million dollar budget segal being paid of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie 
timberlake s performance almost made attack the screen it wasn t all bad i just think the reporters role was wrong for him ll cool j played the typical rapper role toughest baddest guy around i don t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie not even when proposed to his girlfriend morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie kevin spacey wasn t good or bad he was just there overall it s a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors 
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped 
it has been said a city on hill cannot hide itself and virginia city nevada perched on the side of mt davidson at ft west of tahoe is a prime example or in the context of the movie should be virginia city exploded in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver suspiciously the same year the civil war began it was the birthplace of the dean of american letters it was where a young reporter named samuel clemens began using the name mark twain and went on to become america s most famous writer it was also the birthplace of the great hearst fortune and the launching pad of john mackay who became the wealthiest man in america the third wealthiest man in the world hey they should have made the movie about him in the s virginia city was the boomtown of all boomtowns the home of the big bonanza at one time the largest metropolitan area west of st louis and east of san francisco but virginia city the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash north south duello between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott flynn is capt kerry bradford a union officer who is a pow in a concentration camp run by a mean confederate commander named capt vance irby played by scott these two are always getting in each other s way bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of vc by who else other than irby hey what s he doing here horrible bogart plays a laughable mexican bandit who can t decide who s side he s on miriam hopkins plays a murky character named julia hayne obviously a historical lunge at the town s first lady julia bulette who in real life a celebrated prostitute she goes to washington and talks honest abe about saving bradford not irby from hanging and blah blah blah go figure they shoulda hung the writer in real life twain reports that on the last day of the war the setting sun caused the american flag atop mt davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire kind of like the movie three days later they discovered that on that day the south capitulated one interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks alan hale and guin williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot like they re fishing or trying to make the bullets go faster not a bad idea for the movie the same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie gosh how could they miss the gold madness profligate wealth gun battles in the silver mines mark twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown the crooked railroad the opera house fire artemis ward bulette s huge funeral the chinese tongs the black saloons the auction all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert the truth was unreal did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust well if you count this movie it wouldn t be the first debacle to come out of virginia city it s a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a city of illusions where it is said evil seeps out of the ground okay other than that it s a fun movie flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they re destroying if flynn would just play his rotten self i d double my rating 
being a fan of cheesy horror movies i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try now that i ve seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet i get my movie rentals for free and i feel that i didn t get my moneys worth i ve seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time hell i m a fan of them but this was just an insult 
slashers outta stars not really a very good movie but i did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with the movie is ostensibly an episode of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them the survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad none of the real people seem real at all the actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and that s exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show the movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another i would imagine 
how can this movie have a this movie was a piece of skunk s t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw it second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t v show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s t they call a movie rating 
i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a year old political science student and i think i m going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides she s cute she s no super model but more of a cute girl next door ok so she cried and screamed a lot it s very dramatic and seems overdone but doesn t it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in as for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by micro budget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation it s basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megan s shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best character i give this film out of it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro budget horror 
its spelled s l a s h e r s i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like e list and it s shown well in the movie not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated 
slashers well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don t even bother it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being killers on the loose and whoever live s at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would nt mind having a go at this game especially for so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind 
i couldn t help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon a massively more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea this could have been a great film the acting is from some of the actors alright from others it s downright horrible that aside the idea is great and the format is great the story is pretty good as well though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind nevermind that though right it is a horror movie after all i really want to see this remade i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be however and you can t really fault the minds behind the movie for this this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget and the fx really hurt the film overall great movie if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx whoever wrote it should keep going though great idea here 
more wide eyed hysterical s hyper cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti social pathological behaviour danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy it s a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in nursing homes i kinda thought about suing them for torture as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor defenseless ear drums i felt instant strong pain envelop my entire being that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits nevermind glass why didn t you switch the channel if you didn t like it you might ask angrily fair point fair point the answer is that i wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor writhing in agony with my last ounces of energy i tried to reach the remote but couldn t a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven who then proceeds to pigmalionize him lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up this may seem like a rather thin plot but this noisy movie is so chock full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all this movie is relentless forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer s reign in blood as in a south park episode whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange s musical world it s all infantile as if they were all year olds impersonating grown ups i can only envy people who find movies like this funny it must be great being easy to please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gut busting comedy but let s examine this phenomenon the s musical my best guess is that s musicals offered the more day dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven depending on whether you re church going or lenin s tomb going or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy inspired places ttono is more akin to a representation of hell but that s just me i don t seem to get musicals people talk there is a story but then all of a sudden everyone starts singing for about minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened when you think about it musicals are stranger than any science fiction film worse yet ttono my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a s musical but one with opera squealing opera is proof that there is such a thing as over training a voice to the point where it becomes an ear piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet i tried lowering the volume i lowered it from to then from to then i ended up lowering it to a which is usually so low that it s only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys take the scene in the small boat in the river danza starts off with one of his deafening brain killing tunes and then nothing no animals anywhere to be seen even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left if you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes no this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora and those trees were just matte paintings imagine how real trees would have reacted the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self explosion i can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache 
pathetic worse than a bad made for tv movie i can t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freeman s character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boy s girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked 
a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza s mgm contract at the time as reported by member lastliberal above grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera in addition his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable after doing their second and last film together toast of new orleans the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b mayer s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again period mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza so grayson s statement stuck grayson went on to star in a number of widely received and far more profitable musicals with howard keel and others later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences 
i really didn t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn t any unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator 
this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the ohio valley are i m from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are i ve lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there we laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dread martha s character was the worst drawn it s doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there i ve read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isn t shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurt just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level 
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in bubble comes to at films end i am reminded of last years machinist with christian bale the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters an understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life the title is cause for contemplation perhaps we the audience are the ones in the bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim minute running time audience reactions were often smug and judgmental clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w back in office for a second term it s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role this film has it s merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn t say outright 
i just saw this at the venice film festival and can t quite decide about it we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didn t compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates at a running time of just over an hour the characters weren t very well developed lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment forklifts conveyor belts shovels and the slightly creepy looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people an interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together 
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn t even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh i ve been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrap stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competent the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didn t know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it s not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was not the hunter s point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco you ve seen it done before and you ve seen it done better even the video game was better despite the generic non locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one 
if he wanted to be accurate he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free not sucker free i ve lived in sf my entire life and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did everything was over dramatized and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his warriors jersey not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made up sf or oakland jerseys that aren t even sold around here hp has no bowling alleys black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china s olympic team nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops further while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission all that was shown was some white dude and a self proclaimed west coast boriqua this is not new york puerto ricans here are few and far between and the latinos in the mission are very very different from the one that was shown here who was without a doubt from ny also hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs fillmore sunnydale lakeview etc this film could ve been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with 
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst k it s super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don t know why i watched this 
superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts made to stop them how tom selleck and donna mills careers managed to survive this is beyond me however the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all avoid this one if possible 
it s and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well fans will be upset and certainly the seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable it s not much more but it s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom selleck unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen is quickly trumped by actors like dick butkus it s a silly story about super bowl betting pj jackson is charged by new york read mafia for ensuring the game ends for their favor in this case a bet pj is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the unsuspected lainie takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isn t known for certain but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist it s a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there weren t any silly typical s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you ll survive maybe a 
the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the man s name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad rip off of legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it 
the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans aren t as they should be from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined despite what you might think when you first read about superdome this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead superdome is another of those lousy soap opera ish s made for tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he s there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hit man yeah right it s about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had with no drama or suspense in sight superdome ends up being a very poor example of a s made for tv movie the lone highlight for me was the voice over work from the late charlie jones a sportscaster i miss listening to the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest like most others who have seen superdome i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater it may be one of the ktma public access episodes but it s one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though i ve only rated superdome a i ll give this episode a generous on my mst k rating scale 
comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic speaking of timeliness there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong there were sly reference such as they paved paradise to put up a parking lot the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie very little of what the characters said were believable combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail although there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said rick shroeder was quite good showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in n y p d blues 
when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie i was like score i admit i was eager to see the movie and i have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way then it went all down hill i didn t expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort especially his role nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war if anyone really wants to know how communism was like sit down and read a book on it and not one that praises it or is against it just the cold hard facts i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky s body but that was all that interested me everything else about this movie irritated me 
no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue the watts riots with a cast of ugh dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look alike with the most annoying smile since mr sardonicus noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of shindig sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy stick s woody these people are animals these people are my family as the shirelles sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a reefer madness of the s except it s not even funny 
i saw this back in when it was finally released apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy i think the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier i have problem remembering details partly because i haven t seen it in a long time but i do remember it as a very dull movie i kept debating whether to walk out of it the store was not at all interesting or engaging was a rd rate america graffiti imitation none of the performances make it worth watching either one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating 
couldn t go to sleep the other night so i got up flipped on the tube this movie was on film makers bit off more than they could chew just as ambitious in scope as forrest gump was but gump read like an fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era tgmb just relies on tired clich s to tell the story almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up every character s purpose was to fill a silly s archetype take how we re introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid receiving a framed picture of mlk criminey talk about heavy handed why not just give him a t shirt saying i heart black people sunshine isn t free love groovay man oh no i didn t have my period mary beth i want to go to berkeley not square ucla uh excuse me there was nothing square about la in the s rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique we just hear this brat whine about not going there can t even remember the black kid s name he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are thing is period pieces don t have to be this cheesy take dazed confused look how we re introduced to the football hero randall floyd we don t first see him on the football field in fact we never see him play football we re introduced to him in class inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party in dazed feminism isn t a casual by product of some chick getting knocked up it s much more organic more serious than that it s refined in the ladies room over a flip discussion about gilligan s island serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings but real life is like that some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant i agree which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby boomer pornostalgia 
major league back to the minors starring scott bakula eric bruskotter corbin bernsen dennis haysbert jensen daggett written and directed by john warren minutes rated pg for language and some violence by blake french believe it or not in the new john warren comedy major league back to the minors there is one funny scene it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face it s not much but with the exception of a few one liners it s all this film has to offer enough said this movie is not only structurally impaired characteristically undeveloped predictable and badly written but also just plain bad even non critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got it is so familiar it just isn t funny how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made last years we saw this same material in air bud golden receiver and as bad as that film was this is even worse at least air bud was family oriented major league back to the minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon it is too childish for adults so who is this film for teenagers elderly people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this the film like many others like this has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes where the silly announcers form their own buddy comedy routine muttering one liners to themselves like they suck this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost maybe it was his mind somebody needs a nap and ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny major league back to the minors is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence the good baseball team is on a comeback they are about to win and the power goes out i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion but in reality its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny there is another kind of funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer the coach s answer you re too old too slow and too fat the player s reaction is to die for but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time and certainly is not worth a cent of your money so here is another dreadful entr e into this genre of film another that is doomed with its own script which is failed before seen and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again 
this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame 
how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesn t compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick on the field action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine inning shutout what s next major league return to the little league ehh could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all star game this one s had three strikes too many 
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn t clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that edison isn t a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didn t they make it a real city the only writing that was decent was tilman in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list 
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can t believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can t tell me this wasn t the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don t watch this junk 
this movie is so bad it s funny it stars scott backula as some coach but that s not important what is important is the large black fellow who plays st base first off he has to be at least years old yet still plays minor league baseball second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk let alone run coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film spoiler he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run clearly downtown viewed this as a good move he hit the home run and won the game for his team a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie now if only tony muser manager of the royals would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game 
okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoiler it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughter s friend is the girl in the way she always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don t waste your time watching this 
this is one very dire production the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal she was a very beautiful young woman here was the production s weakest point the actress failed to get that across it also appeared that the production budget couldn t stretch to a hairdresser from the outset the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical the production was a flaw ridden clich ridden embarrassing load of rubbish i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas 
for months i ve been hearing about this little movie and now i ve seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people s creative ideas in order to make their own one joke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood s door then they re doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase it s animal house meets back to the future it s wall street meets dead poet s society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable 
way back in a certain director had no idea about a galaxy far away or near he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it this is merely an advertising promo for the director actors et al it has little intrinsic artistic value it is a brochure the lead playing george is very fine as is the leia character and the ersatz darth character all else is plain commercial dross what a waste still it got the job done i guess the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess a brochure only 
where s michael caine when you need him i ve seen most of the many seasons of mst k but this rare pre st season flick episdoe k is easily one of the worst movies ever made three stars lee majors chris makepeace and burgess meredith struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness possibly on super makes logan s run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare i can t imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it s unwatchable even with it clearly what s needed in hollywood is some sort of k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care with its rights to pollute and drive theme by the end i m half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech lee i could have forgiven you for this in but 
stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades old gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway techno wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film 
this juvenile bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens bodies desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years how by burning up gas and equating a fast reckless car or plane with freedom the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers neighborhood if it were run my an oil conglomerate and logan s run if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post gas crisis world in which an all powerful government doesn t want you to ahem drive your car and burn gas sort of the opposite of today s enron and bush oil grabbing suv pushing government this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable but wait there s more although the film is set in the future we re not shown any signs of future technology beyond a return to bicycles golf carts and horses you will believe that the future looks exactly like today same clothing same suburban houses same green lawns as today and when the film was made there are no solar panels no windmills no concessions to alternate energy the acting is flat and flavorless even scenes which could have been gritty or moving buddy flick honor romance horror all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase continuity is lacking the jet flown by burgess meredith s character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode even die hard car film and sf fans should avoid this film like month old roadkill unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero s gas tank 
i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only years old i recently re watched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard if you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role does did nothing for their careers anyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i ve heard of but the execution failed horribly 
there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlake s acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isn t all bad just mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten he s not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all t s just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia 
after watching this on the mst k episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of logans run farenheight final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f race car going all the way across the country 
dull flatly directed comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it s not enough one of those scripts that if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion 
one of the lamer wedding movies you ll see smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke except they just aint in the least bit funny here molly ringwald well what else needs to be said give you a clue to the silliness she destroys a wedding dress because it just won t be me makes it into this rag with straps and puts on a top hat and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy rather than ringwalding her neck its a helluva a cast too check out how heavy ally sheedy is wheeeew 
with this film bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film s might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of objectivity obviously it is not for one reason many scenes shot by pure chance are obvious set ups when that poor goat accidently falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film that is goitre a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research heck if he checked cretinism in a medical dictionary he d have found goitre he might have ended up telling the truth about these people still doubtfully instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as cretins again and again dramatizing the action setting up scenes to create the spectacle all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all mighty objectivity bunuel talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming he talks for them and even then judges them this piece is flawed to it s roots to it s ideology and it s a real shame it s considered a great film 
this minute documentary bu uel made in the early s about one of spain s poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let s admit that years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that bu uel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror bu uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn t bu uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people 
the writer director of this film obviously doesn t know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn t give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if it s playing poker then you must be hurt n 
as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in it basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn t one i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn t have wasted buying it off ebay take it from me avoid like offsuit dire 
totally ridiculous if you know anything about poker you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker but i doubt he s ever played above i think he also knows nothing of golf where to start i ve seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma scotty nguyen and the loser who can never win at poker everyone else is as wooden as they come like bad porn actors spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made he is a railbird who doesn t play poker and never has a line of dialogue but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie i can t think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production it s fitting that he had such a useless role there s very little poker in this movie most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren t resolved in the slightest queen momma does have a show stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them their subtle performances are easily among the film s highlights it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads in conclusion complete nonsense plan from outer space has slightly more coherency if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh also if you re christian you might enjoy some of the heavy handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper i hate movies made by religious people especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about it s sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i can t help but think less of them they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders 
when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak 
people please don t bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it s totally waste of time i don t see any point here it s a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again 
honestly before i watched this movie i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie and watched it by my own apparently they were right i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did i watch this movie of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie theater business but morgan and kevin i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison to be honest their roles are rather stupid well you might think if the players suck then i should pay more attention to the story it is indeed story is the core of a movie but guys trust me this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story imagine this a smart ass journalist justin timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a real journalist from his boss morgan freeman this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice ll cool j and an brilliant investigator kevin spacey at the end they beat the system with a happy ending story jeez i could not even carry on with this just recalling the movie is making me sick already my advise guys don t watch this please save your money and time for another movie 
amateur no budget films can be surprisingly good this however is not one of them ah another brad sykes atrocity the acting is hideous except for emmy smith who shows some promise the camera direction needs serious reworking and no more hold the camera and run gimmicks either it just doesn t work the special effects are unimaginative there s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time if you re going to rip off an ear please don t let us see the actor s real ear beneath the blood the scenery is bland and boring same as mr sykes other ventures and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal see the scenery comment did i mention the lack of any real plot or character development apparently the scriptwriter didn t whoever is funding this guy please stop i ve seen some of his other home movies which i will not plug and they are just as bad normally a director will grow and learn from his previous efforts not this guy it s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker but anyone can be a hack definitely not even a popcorn film of course chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort award the worst ever military push ups in a film 
an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn t reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending 
this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up minutes but the director insists on using all minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything 
murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn t considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues don t they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they ve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan gosling the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually he d be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren t bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn t redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn t going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there s nothing to see here people move along keep moving 
well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn t bad but it wasn t that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn t predictable was done so badly that it didn t matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn t really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldn t reccomend it i gave it out of b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you ll like this one 
at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn t seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn t so now there s a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don t waste your time or money 
so i m wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock s wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from miss congeniality did ms bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before gracie hart as many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest the two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films as has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes one last peeve using the term serial killer is false advertising murdering one person even if it s a premeditated murder does not make you a serial killer you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer 
from director barbet schroder reversal of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i recognised the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard haywood half nelson s ryan gosling and justin pendleton bully s michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie the hyena mayweather sandra bullock with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating hairs the plan doesn t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills chris penn as ray feathers r d call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst d a al swanson i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable adequate 
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him the main subject of this bullock vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock s classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime nietsche s philosophy and the clues that the boys disseminate the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an eighty minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it pits two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually bullock plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless girlie the two boys performances are not really mind boggling not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear well you know rope was so good 
there s something frustrating about watching a movie like murder by numers because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there s no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra bullock and ben chaplin s homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on although bullock is strong in her role it s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben chaplin s talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated birthday girl as well as chris penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn t even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it s too bad they weren t in a much better all around film barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it s worth a rent if you re a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks 
having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock s performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky self effacing roles ms bullock s performance in serious roles see hope floats speed days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the sub plot of sandra s past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catch me if can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplin s token partner love interest character spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it s conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of 
lets enter the world of this movie for a second so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars shouting at them and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief instead of just walking up and pop what do you do the bad guy he talks to him he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun they have nothing to talk about shoot him shoot him now but he talks to him anyway oh another thing at the end a newspaper says pulitzer prize winner story right here or something right above on a front page of a paper when its like the first time the story is printed so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast yea you know those types of stupid movies yea well that s edison in a nutshell you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places and who s last line duck was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks little cocky bastard the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best denzel from training day impression which was pretty entertaining oh yea so whats the movie about eh something about scandals involving the city edison s fictional special unit police force called f r a t i swear i m not making this stuff up which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s w a t anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving undercover cops from frat and he goes scurrying off looking for a story gaining his boss freeman trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought blah blah blah its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day the pacing was slow and off the script was horrible and the acting was extremely uninspired it jumped everywhere without going anywhere people get put in comas and you forget about them everyone in this movie just didn t think damn what a stupid movie its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended no lie basically do not waste your time 
hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass s history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere watch any episode of csi instead it s to the point and far more exciting 
except for acknowledging some nice cinematography i can hardly say anything positive about this movie the single real issue is the protagonist s dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere the director only manages to introduce anthony s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution the characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for sonny beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as self indulging amateurs i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left 
they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once they re grown it s easy to spot the writer director among the four he s the quiet contemplative long haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only there s no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still can t figure out which one he is here s a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you don t quite get the self important speeches or the slow motion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what you re supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah that s the ticket why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world can t wait to see it onscreen if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants 
a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn t build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn t really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn t understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can t decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don t even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all plot characters acting overall i feel like that s too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top 
dick foran and peggy moran who were so good together in the mummy s hand return for this very minor universal horror offering but this time instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick babe we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named stuff but the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually nil dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as the phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself this phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness it s always nice to see perky moran but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal s instantly forgettable misfires 
a horribly pointless and worse boring film stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey s truman show and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights for well pretty much nothing emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews i ve read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy please that she ended up falling for ferrell s character is utterly ludicrous marc forster s attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this i wish i d opted for the prestige 
stranger than fiction angered me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thought provoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didn t will ferrell hear emma thompson s voice years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone rang the phone rang again how could she not know it s him calling etc the movie challenges one s thoughts about mortality fate and sacrifice the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith ah but the ending until the very end i would have given out of stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for life s journey as a tribute to the notion of writing true as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell s fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been debated for weeks no no credits rolled say it isn t so say hollywood didn t tack on another minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said it s no longer a masterpiece it s ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasn t even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of writing true about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i don t often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this one my questions for zack helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powers that be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself i ve read you re brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first time i know zack helm will never see this review and i ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please movie goers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now 
a badly acted two character comedy drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren t we awful to the indians polemic with lousy special effects exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence it s as sincere as a politician s handshake as obvious as a car salesman s pitch one of the worst movies in the history of the universe absolute and utter dreck 
 spoilers contained i d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific what i didn t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go what starts off as a typical cowboy indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about honus soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss and cresta candice bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason they then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them so far so ordinary then comes the ending after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they won t they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn t resort to extreme gratuitous violence in some ways soldier blue reminds me of frank perry s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending i didn t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents i would recommend elem klimov s come and see 
soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man s inhumanity to man on the white man s exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbish another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clich d poorly acted odd couple romance strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other s lifestyle and falling in love ah bless bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn t have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick there is no excuse for the repulsive prurient gore drenched climax in which cute little native american children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close up and large breasted native american women are molested raped and strung up no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few special effects sequences of beheading dismemberment dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming now that s what i call exploitation forget all the pap you ve heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples this film doesn t give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the us and britain and all so called civilised nations have participated in over the centuries iraq this just isn t that movie 
the movie started off strong ll cool j deed as an undercover police officer with partner sgt lazerov dylan mcdermott from the practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience the other big names freeman spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promise the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake pollack is introduced given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake i would choose the former even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him i would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years everything he did in this film was unconvincing just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films even hardcore n sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent that aside there are a few plot holes such as pollack s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery this movie had so much promise thoroughly disappointing 
first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti war propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above here s an idea why don t you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk
when sam peckinpah s superlative the wild bunch opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so with a talented if whisky marinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah s epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that category soldier blew er blue tells the story of foul mouthed new yorker cresta lee candice bergen a blonde proto hippie chick who s been rescued from two years of captivity among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she ll be reunited with the fianc e she only wants to marry for his money also on board the wagon she s traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills accompanied by honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman calling gant by the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played by donald pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and that s saying something and in the tradition of many previous western set romantic comedies each other during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably and predictably attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on while gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn t filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won t spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby to be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what s coming what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead in to a hideous reenactment of the sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded a nice effect i have to admit women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs no joke this scene would instantly garner an nc rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted i m all in favor of westerns that don t shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it s a heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well duh then it s a light hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of buck toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub plot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film s promotion and poster imagery but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy mulligan stew of presumably well intentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldn t it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity 
other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinker this is the second film that i ve seen in recent days directed by alexander korda the first was charles laughton s rembrandt it was so lousy that i shut it off this one i m afraid is not very much better flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion robson states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit even a dashing laurence olivier can t save this utter piece of boredom future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn t really convey anything here to think that scarlett was years later it s a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film 
i remembered the title so well to me it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles and it had vincent massey s voice from behind whiskers well flora robson was great her next signature for me would be days at peking the same role but with different sumptuous gowns and the same voice as for the armada it was a subtext i like black and white films was everything done in elizbethan times at night it was talky and difficult to fathom at times i couldn t tell which was the love interest was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada apparently it worked for the empire but not for the script this might have been more accurate historically but bette davis had more engaging scripts and i missed daylight 
spoilers well the one line summary says it all melville s le samurai is the original and there are elements of leon and they are better much better in the samurai alain delon is a lonely warrior professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs with so much suspense in these scenes even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog but i guess jarmusch liked leon very much or even desperado by rodriguez so he added this too and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog like natalie portman in leon so what was jarmusch thinking after all where is the unique the original thought in this movie i can t see the point in making carbon celluloid copies a rating by macaulay connor
now i ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory however the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading it is also offensive i am a quarter cree indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of whitaker s character first of all he s a black guy and this isn t a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents the katana represents the soul of a samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a katana anyway it must be one of those replicas which insults the samurai caste even more also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates none the less then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushi samurai holds dear bleah
 don t bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilyn the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why nellie monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didn t need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didn t fit her and it s no surprise it wasn t one of her more popular films it s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne bancroft elisha cook jr jeanne cagney donna cocoran and others summary it s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game 
this is a well worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman s noose then sets about taming his reluctant bride it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time we never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own this only made sense in fifties hollywood there s a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip the second time then yanks her off her horse never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip then he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp that s some second wind later he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now she s his squaw never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she s been negotiating with them for years and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him yeah right like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy the only reason you d root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film s end the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow up dolls even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore you total waste of time even the scenery s kinda dull give this one a big miss 
to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it but i m never one to let others influence my viewings in fact i m more likely to watch something out of defiance bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away the picture isn t very good and is in fact very morally dubious all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form all motivated by greed or egocentric victories this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture sadly it doesn t and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can t help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film nobody in the cast come out with any credit with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone 
i m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night i don t think i ll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i ll bet we won t be seeing this one next season 
beginning with the poster featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey the entire movie was a fraud one stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least after minutes you realize that you ve just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop flick basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what they ve got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it frat cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist one hour later after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you can t beat the system bah don t see this waste of film roll freeman and spacey barely have min altogether 
happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i d be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead character s reaction to the ghost is laughable i can only agree that the glowing reviews of this film are from friends and family i m afraid it s not even entertainingly bad amateur in the extreme avoid avoid avoid 
frankly i m rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it s brilliant when it s not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i e continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes it s his first film low budget etc i get it but it s also out there for members of the public to purchase and it s just not up to scratch 
it s one of those dramas that s so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it s good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn t at least destroy any speeches there s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this 
when thinking about captivity many words come to mind among them are uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchable i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they re aimed at feel like they re hardcore and hip this movie is a load of boring crap what the hell has happened to larry cohen his name hasn t been attached to anything good since even so i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad was anyone surprised when the movie s love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths did anyone not know it when they first saw him only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie 
i ll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl s drink imprisons and tortures her then poses as a captive to have sex with her that is the single twist and punchline of the film it s torture as slow motion date rape and it s not even a good movie it s not so bad it s good it s just bad it should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile why no one had the cojones to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond me don t give your money to these poop peddlers 
the only reason i give it a is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on this film is asinine it s like so many other st century grind house fodder the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting i didn t care about any of the characters but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i d complain about the money i spent but my date and i wisely left after minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining live free or die hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of captivity for minutes 
absolutely fantastic now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latt s allow me to elaborate much as i enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i ve seen at the cinema an impressive claim as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen the two leads daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst of course they weren t helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence the plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to non existent and the gore scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic what plot there is revolves around a twenty something model cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout for my part i came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film making whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film p s i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free so i can afford to laugh about it i was still tempted to ask for my money back it really was that bad 
the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor a holocaust survivor part of mengele s experiments on twins consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments the movie obviously had great reviews it s one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about i too for a large part of the movie got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar in one of the many dramatic sequences as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center the meaning of the word forgive is even debated but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own but by this time the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more after the strong willed eva kor forgives her nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about at least from the viewpoint of kor the movie goes about following her past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory to me this was the meat of the movie surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness obviously it was a very sick cow on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness in order to heal wounds of the past she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some arabs to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis including one at a jewish center in chicago from then on anyone not so teary eyed that they can t see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements firstly you immediately notice her body language defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time effort and money the entire act was a rather annoyed dr sami advan professor of education at bethlehem university gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment finally the debate at the jewish center in chicago where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts i will cut to the chase by the end of the movie i was hoping i hadn t chosen to watch the movie the movie was badly made failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears it showed that kor the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate lastly is everyone so retarded today that they can t notice the difference between making peace and forgiving quoting another imdb user i don t see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul she wanted the suffering to be over so she let it go that would be the perfect layman s definition of making peace i guess in a world of propaganda blind faith and political correctness there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathom p s the dictionary certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making 
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to it s expectations the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the asian directors but doesn t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid explainable interesting angle basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases the acting was very good however all the actors gave good performances and jude law was outstanding as he is always is it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film 
jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in eroticism excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a one note plot the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law s character and a dogged homicide detective well played by timothy spall but despite their best efforts both actors are staked to the cross of the film s banality with a lesser actor in the lead role and without the benefit of oliver curtis s cinematography crocodiles would blend into the sea of low budget vampire quickies 
ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected he did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department from the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he s in he acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job he was quite clearly the best character in the movie this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner there are so many ways his character moses ashford could have taken a more pivotal role that he didn t was disappointing and a true let down i was hoping to see more from him in this film timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past being an action movie it has its share of shoot em up scenes blood and guts these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot out what irked me most was the way timberlake s character behaved during shoot out scenes he starts out having guns and not using them then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he s been firing a gun his whole life then he runs out of bullets and doesn t have a gun and seconds later without moving or anything suddenly has more fully loaded guns and extra ammo little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then you ll probably love this movie personally it doesn t matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic make me believe that the story is true this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied 
i love all types of films especially horror that being said survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it i can t give it any points on originality there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or remaking what others have done it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods a crazed killer and as of lately throw in some crazy family on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw wrong turn though the twist in that one is obvious and others survival falls up way short against comparable films the plot was just not original in any way some films can get by with a weak and way over done plot with superb acting special fx or a slew of other factors survivial doesn t have any of that to bank on if you will note the following the acting in the movie never took off i don t knock or blame the actors for that nor the director the dialogue was at best mediocre and the actors involved never showed not saying didn t have the talent to pull it off i mention standouts the leading man in this film certainly has the look but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film the actor who portrayed greg also had potential but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why you won t believe it the grainy film look ah yes that little tid bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of grindhouse films in today s film making that has become a gimmick it either works or it doesn t in this case it just does not work there are too many other flaws going on so it winds up distracting from the film not adding to it that being said i think they did a good job of adding that grain that is some good quality grain i think with a different script better direction and possibly actors they should try another grindhouse attempt they will probably pull it off as far as the tech aspects in my opinion they never quite gelled for me either better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on dv it was too soft for my taste that is all i have to say about that 
this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness i don t even have the vocabulary to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is hey what d ya know i do set in a post apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn t make head or tail of any of it seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful and not in a its so bad it s good cult way it is just awful awful awful awful honestly if you still don t believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even gerbils on acid couldn t hope to understand this avoid or even better destroy 
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there s nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together percent of the cast are white males about same age it s almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they don t redeem the flat monotony the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that can t be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation i went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it s more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it s a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part i guess he thinks he s tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing at the opening in la wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure 
this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these a holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost 
i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j fox we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and bills if i ever let anybody use a room for some afternoon delight time i d be fired on the spot the organization to which i belong les clefs d or has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously similarly untrue was the concept at the end of the movie of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary in short it does a disservice to our organization i welcome any comments 
i expected alot from this movie kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie i can t even explain this movie it had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes tidal waves and earthquakes but that was at the end the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn t this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings the whole movie is missleading and boring one of lees worst 
end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i m not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job job requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that s the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they re on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he s ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they re going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn t help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there s lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed 
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening scene don t be fooled by the title end of the world is truly a bad movie i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit 
end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled like tentacles a good cast does not mean it ll be a good film the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on the rest of the cast is shown briefly like lew ayres dean jagger and macdonald carey as a security guard i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re animater and dolls i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer john carridine and dean jagger well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it lucky them if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards alligator and game of death sue lyon lolita is also in the movie minus her lollipop if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie out of 
what can i say about this film other than don t see it i waited and waited and waited for someting or anything to happen and it just didn t come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly it s just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of pet monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they don t like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their minute work or art garbage and decided that they d let the editing crew turn it into an minute feature film watch at your own peril it s not even funny because it s so bad it s just bad 
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a director writer of wiseguy making his feature debut blah well the director writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster this movie is absolutely appalling it s a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever there is nothing new with edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy this was the best casted direct to video movie i ve ever seen some examples of just bad silly moments in edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles llcoolj driving a vintage firebird guys being shot in the head this movie is the opposite of good stay away from edison 
dull cheap sci fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i m here strictly for the money performances 
a good deal of running around a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens along with his pretty wife he invades their territory and is given secrets about them he becomes rather traitorous in the process granted he is given little choice anyway there is a scene where he gives them everything they want this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens the plot isn t technically bad it s just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building this is what editing is all about i suppose the story wouldn t technically support much more not much here

christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i m trying to view all of his work he has been known to single handedly save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and it s production values are disturbing please for the love of christopher avoid this film 
spoilers wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he s trying to figure out who s receiving the messages and who s also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and he s gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesn t see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end that s it i ve never seen such a dull movie in my life it s the most underwhelming movie i ve ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they don t care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they don t even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasn t expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didn t expect it to be this bad christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well i m sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst it s beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever 
it s got christopher lee it s got huge banks of s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen it s got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises it s got volcanoes evil aliens disguised as nuns tidal waves earthquakes exploding cars exploding coffee machines and as a climax the entire planet blows up how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly mind numbingly dull the answer my friend is because of this movie is made up of establishing shots most of them involving long tracks pans or zooms in combinations or occasionally all three that do nothing except give the crew something to do there are endless shots of our protagonists driving getting in and out of cars driving again walking around looking at stuff getting in cars and driving i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering say something please somebody just say something do something anything the dialogue when it does come is terrible maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours was a typically meaningless line the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage justified in this speech from lee as the head alien the planet earth has emitted an over abundance of diseases they are contaminating the universe all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed this is is neanderthal sf script writing this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of s japanese monster suit movies aimed at year olds it is and i collect such things the most god awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters lee who always struck me as a smart useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek i don t blame him 
your mind will not be satisfied by this no budget doomsday thriller but pray who s will a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people small _apocalyptically themed outing end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely s similar movies and it s not only that but eotw plays like a hybrid not only doomsday but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a well known character actor this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent exploitation that significantly s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated anyway the convent s secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride 
this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee dean jagger macdonald carey lew ayres solid b movie actors all but this downer of a movie didn t use any of them to any sort of advantage with none of their characters even meeting on screen though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat first they just want to repair their ship and leave then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need then out of nowhere this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end just in vengeance for boring us to death unless you really like chris lee or seventies low budget sci fi i d give this one a miss it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo target earth 
the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band s assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it 
i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or special effect in the entire movie about and even some that weren t in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies 
that is the only question i am left with why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast why was the writing so bad it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters why did it not make any sense at all why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they re released i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey who are oscar winners that this never is released to the big screens in america as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism the whole story is just utterly laughable i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clich and an awful one at that just no 
this movie was terrible i rented it not knowing what to expect i watched the st minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb the acting was bad and there was no plot the monster is soooooo fake it growls and its mouth doesnt move also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster just plain bad don t even waste your time out of 
wow i just saw this on t v as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated g there wasn t really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a spoof but i don t think so for a spoof you need something called humor this low budget crap fest didn t have a shred of humor and it didn t make much sense either you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets killing people i guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so i guess that s good enough the military tries feebly to kill the monster which isn t much larger than a man they have very bad aim then the military flees wow did this movie make the u s military look pathetic or what the monster while hard to kill doesn t do much besides shuffle around and roar oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks it was a slightly interesting yet a total alien ripoff what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality also why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long why didn t the monster go into the closet when it had a chance why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless 
now i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching in the same way that you watch a car crash i appreciate the fact it s a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the god awful directing acting and dialogue seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper and a poor one at that okay a few criticisms when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive the army attack from about yards away and we see a flame thrower being used geez those things have a range of no more than metres when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid and the soldiers don t try to shoot the monster come on the monster looks like it something out of power rangers there is one scene where the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid all look shocked and we get reactions along the lines of hand to mouth one after the other so natural the general just runs away time after time the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn t listen the acting is awful did i mention the rubber suit monster that god awful music non stop 
yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal 
the head of a common new york family jane gail as mary barton works with her younger sister ethel grandin as loma barton at smyrner s candy store after ms grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves ms gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore as larry burke must rescue the virtue threatened young woman traffic in souls has a reputation that is difficult to support it isn t remarkably well done and it doesn t show anything very unique in having a young woman s virtue threatened by sex traders perhaps it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length claimed to have been ten reels originally the new york city location scenes are the main attraction after all these years the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move traffic in souls george loane tucker jane gail matt moore ethel grandin
kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie s character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirstie s brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it 
 st watched out of dir jon keeyes over the top rehash of s supposed horror flicks like friday the th versions thru whatever i can t think of much redeeming here except or can i think of anything the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an homage to this supposedly but lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered again how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this guess what the murderer is at it again and we re tipped off from the very beginning who it is so there goes any mystery whatsoever and besides all this where are the cops and why doesn t someone call them i can t believe this movie was financed by someone and made you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher at least in their movie going experience but not so by this filmmaker 
this piece ain t really worth a comment it s simply the worst horror movie i have ever seen the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry shame on you i say 
without a doubt this is one of the worst films i ve ever wasted money on the plot is erm sorry did i say there was a plot the scariest moment was when nope can t think of one the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope can t think of one for that either you knew who the killer was right from the start there was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister misty in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie 
this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke the acting got progressively worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem that was not intelligent truthfully stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends 
wow i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had his acting was painful to observe the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors heck even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be ok watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human kermit the frog act in a hollywood blockbuster just didn t work at all 
 american nightmare is officially tied in my opinion with it s pat for the worst movie of all time seven friends oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of friends gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare a pirate radio show it s hosted by a guy with a beard that s the most exciting aspect of his show chandler monica joey and oh wait i mean wayne jessie and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj unbeknownst to them a crazed nurse serial killer is listening crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and wait sorry again by making their fears come to life these fears include such stunners as voodoo and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures no really this movie was in a word rotten crazy nurse s killing spree lacks motivation there s nothing to make the viewer jump the ending blows and again voodoo if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones rent american nightmare with them if you care for your loved ones even a little bit go to your local blockbuster rent all of the copies of american nightmare and hide them in your freezer 
this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time first as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie the prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife its absolutely ridiculous i was not scared at all during the movie which i thought horror movies were supposed to do as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of scary movie for example at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie 
when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the for dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks let s put in something else i ll admit a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isn t going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they re over or under doing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesn t even come close to the acting in this film anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie it s the most pointless thing i ve ever had the displeasure of watching do not watch or buy this movie 
when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can t even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it s embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it s quite easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i don t normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don t miss the making of featurette the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it s a new age citizen kane it s like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they ve created something of substance it s sad really the only reason i gave this movie a is because i think should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i d have to say that it s somewhere in the bottom fifty 
in texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears a serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were friday th then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating halloween from this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of c production however the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting with a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie my vote is four title brazil agonia agony 
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap most of the singing is off key i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after wondering when is it ever going to end 
so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like they re coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because it s independent doesn t mean it gets a free pass if you re going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a well written score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp can t save this one it s one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved 
i feel totally ripped off someone needs to refund the i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening what i don t get is why did this get distributed in the first place somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made i ve seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view shot on dv nuff said the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section want to see a good musical then don t rent this movie 
the single worst film i ve ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if you re going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they weren t obvious rhymes they were groan inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and you d think you d find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didn t have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again 
this movie was so terrible it was almost good almost we love musicals but not this one even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can t sing or dance anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance especially toward the end the character marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music admittadly some of the songs fantabulous are pretty catchy but not in a good way open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful we think it might be a good stage musical with excellent actors 
normally i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet well this movie was just terrible it is nigh on impossible to suspend disbelief i tried really i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn t let me timberlake should stick to music what a dreadful performance no presence as an actor no character can t blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot badly timed editing its definitely an f after seeing this i have to wonder what really motivates actors i mean surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part did he not see how poor it was what then could motivate him to take the part money of course acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script meanwhile the audience goes what the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this crap in short apart from justin a great lineup badly executed very disappointing 
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie 
carly pope plays jj a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her jj aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally dimensional jj is a self serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow jj s colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic the underlying message of an over woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film 
i wasn t expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect and even fear my mother but i d put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother s house after all i didn t buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry 
i hate to sound like an old person but frankly i haven t seen too many movies that i like that were made after generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle the bread my sweet except for the de rigeur sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her s though hinted at being in her s i didn t buy it i m and like all the women i know in their s and s more than capable of surviving on my own as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at got legally emancipated and set off on my own life s journey the daughter is not believable in her job role she gets a promotion she doesn t deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an opportunist when she was just doing what any career oriented person would do taking advantage of a wide open opportunity created by the lack of self discipline of her coworker a girl who apparently doesn t understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss in this case the daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is not the common thing for parents to act like children and then be treated as children by their children that is just more of the societal baloney that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings this is a sad movie with a stupid ending if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two dimensional tv character he d have stayed with the mother who was not that much older than him and quite attractive but in the end he falls for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth but in an ordinary bland way the opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physically there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish self centered b tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother a woman who was kindhearted sweet tempered humorous and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend of course the mother had her own flaws she had reacted to her husband s demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney where s the mustard 
having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard hitting fact based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities but this is not it this plays like a bottom to mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the s e g ss experiment camp etc perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power watch channel s the holocaust aired recently still running as of no for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent in context use of actual footage this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie rating as exploitation as a treatment of the subject 
although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn t what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don t eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don t eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose i m not even sure what genre they re going for here just early s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we re in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys don t kill them although i wouldn t have minded if they had in the flashback the year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn t saying much for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it s stupid i guess i didn t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don t eat the babies 
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better as much as i didn t like barracuda that s on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane eye candy one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker my grade f dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive in food and trailers for bonnie s kids features nudity the centerfold girls part time wife features nudity psychic killer eaten alive the dvd also comes with s barracuda 
this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up barracuda i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor and try on chinese style clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch them it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this coin hard to say really now back in the day when these two women were years old they were out with their sisters and their sister s boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when they re away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal tea but the girls and todd did leave the island but now they re returning escorted by their captors and they re there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since there s only three it doesn t take long and there s even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability they re borderline hilarious the hillbilly type family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern california so what the hell is this i m not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh out of very bizarre 
first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episode this episode makes a mockery of the entire show i don t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series there is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokes are crap the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously on is simply embarrassing its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad 
this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark it s writing is lazy absurd self indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing i ve ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate i ve ever seen it s absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously 
i don t remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake s in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the point timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben affleck s acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the clich expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned crusader for justice journalist it simply will not fly however timberlake alone isn t to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and i m surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air but enough of timberlake bashing words aren t enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very run of the mill corruption story it s plot ranges from clich to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown don t get me wrong edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through it the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson s creek episode it s your typical far too glib for reality let s impress the audience with how well we articulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slow motion thinking about it edison is a curiosity it s sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn t work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they don t seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and it s not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with 
i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again the excessive amount of watery blood at the beginning is just plain obsolete not to mention the whip around wind sounds my friends and i made a super low budget movie and the effects still exceeded this crap fest as for the amount of mistakes in this movie there are way too many to count i knew one of the actors believe it or not he was my theatre teacher ha final verdict don t bother with this horror flick stars out of a possible 
 minutes and it felt twice that long brief crossing is not brief enough indeed the first minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue more of a monologue really of a woman approaching middle age tediously droning about men disappointment sex aging and her recent breakup to a french teenager she met in the ship s cafeteria the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty free shop and to a bar where finally her self involved rant pushes him away the story can t end there of course so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin what little romance sex or for that matter anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all yes the ending is very nicely done but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner of course some people like it i could be wrong 
it has its merit s morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments she s so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that s making her so distant and un relatable or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally i d call her dysfunctional morvern is completely detaching herself disposing of her boyfriend not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain she s seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herself despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director s shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunning it s really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest it s little over minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don t care about the characters or the film 
my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never blossomed it started fairly strong with a promising plot then she bakes cookies goes to spain she sulks she stares the credits roll uneven full of holes false starts dead ends we ff d through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried zzzz it s like a beautifully shot chick flick that s pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand morvern at all about halfway through you just don t care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop don t waste your time on this i m shocked it scores so high 
nothing happens then characters with no personality don t develop then the end never comes because there s no beginning and no middle there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren t even allowed to be because this movie isn t even there there s no is in this movie because there s no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point there s nothing there is a good point it has a good soundtrack but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn t even worth your time so if you re really interested i d suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something you ll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue headache and impatience polarisdib
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don t get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross it has every a hem artistic clich in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers 
it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level in order to hear about percent of the dialog some of the talking still remained sub audible if you re from scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down there is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing but this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity after about a half hour i gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either 
when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words i m not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of us people like morvern do no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point possibly the sum of the entire story is the point and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesn t substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing this is not the usual complaint of a book lover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half educated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite morvern s own self characterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working class scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldn t deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn t get out of my head was his character s attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person who s always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical and that doesn t begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morvern s responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see this the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting she s rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesn t have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morvern s responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy serio comic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isn t at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isn t scottish the actress said in an interview she hadn t had time to study up the accent and she ought to be it s important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story morvern s spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest what s left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead 
lynne ramsey makes arresting images and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered pretentious lark ramsey can t bring callar to life her attempts are too arty and oblique repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton s obliterated gaze alone could supply character we are in a blank warholian hell of self indulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist but how will it do so if she rarely speaks without the novel s interior monologue the celluloid morvern callar is nobody small wonder ramsey has morton undress often that said the first ten minutes were so impressively acted shot and edited that my hopes were soaring give the film that much it knows how to make promises if not how to keep any 
i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him i was wrong it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven i really don t care what young lassies from scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take visually the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts that s all there is now i see why her boyfriend killed himself rename it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i m such a sucker for sticking these things out 
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can t stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun ha ha like spielberg did it s like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo s investigation as many later episodes would do 
my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included drinking bleach rubbing sand in my eyes writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy re enacting the american civil war tax returns gcse maths sex with an old lady garrett clancy aka sgt ben draper wrote this the guy couldn t even dig a hole properly the best ting he did was kick a door down the best part of the film this was the worst film i have ever seen and i ve seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself fact do not watch
i m a fan of arty movies but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel agonisingly slow to develop a non existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content 
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general however no spoilers only a brief introductory description buddy portrays four young people living in a flat share in oslo the protagonist are two young men that don t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the clich although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy situations and complicated love affairs i don t find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends yes that show on tv has norwegian film finally found its identity audience pleasers in well known american style how about watching lukas moodysson s tillsammans together 
since rugrats falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years obviously the tyrants at klasky csupo should be out of ideas after dumbing down all of the characters adding even stupider new ones replacing some voices though i like nancy cartwright she is not chucky finster and having no sense of continuity ex in a kimi episode i watched the other day tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode the aforementioned dogs never appear you d think the creators could kill the show for mercy but noooo all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks while not as horrible as the kimi episodes everyone is even stupider than they were including grandpa my god he used to be the best character on the show but now he has no real purpose the ending is needlessly fluffy and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes is that the kids can interact with adults whoa what fun no stars at all for the rugrats all growed up klasky csupo please destroy this show before it gets any worse 
 comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant but we weren t to notice and when colby was a f g triple agent but now in tonight s episode david is trapped with a paranoid nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun in an elevator and he can t disarm him a trained experienced field agent who has been st through the door many times and is experienced in hand to hand fighting can t take out a nut job not when said nut job blinks looks away drops his head closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for seconds then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick love interest amita my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged don gives david the distress word that is the code for the s t is about to go down david is ready they kill the lights drop the elevator startle the nut job and david cannot disarm kill beat into submission the nut job the bad guy ends up with both guns david ends up shot i m done hope the numb rs are fun 
here let me wave my hands over the keyboard i ll tell you what salad she s going to order over and over works like a charm he s such a genius omg how does he do it my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i m scanning channels i have to be very careful these days it s useful far too often so i don t need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this careful with that remote is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery or what why does it exist this is the most inane show completely unbelievable and contrived and i cannot understand why it s still on the air so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time sarah connor chronicles true blood but give this nonsensical drivel a pass shows like firefly if there were any like that fall away after a season but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on yeccch 
as an engineer i must say this show s first season started out very promising most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge but after the first season the show started degrading heavily most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science technology for real the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show if you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second thereafter i would not waste my time myself i gave the show up midway through season season stars season stars season stars let s sum that up to stars since charlie doesn t know his math anymore i won t bother with the correctness of mine either 
after watching a dozen episodes i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models i thought that my profession was being joked about i am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but i do work a lot with mathematical models so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to make believe of fairy tales first choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task charlie eppes is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them isaac asimov even wrote about that in the s even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction second supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known these parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration m s and often are not easy to determine again charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses and after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted third a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci fi movies the computational effort required for solving these models try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow and even with the right software hardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached he solves them immediately i could use his computer in my research work i would be very glad as a drama it is far from being the best show the characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent for some layman the show might work for others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow 
the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock the lame ness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be he does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok mathematically here s where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that math its not even connect the f k g dots this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense it just goes to show when you re a hammer everything looks like a nail i can t wait til they stick the numb rs team on osama they ll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbers totally ludicrous tv show 
this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn t find it on itunes talk about seeing into the future too funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies doesn t say much for the world s viewing habits 
 cia codename alexa is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson s classic film la femme nikita the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o j simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history lamas acting is simply a bad steven segal impersonation watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable there are so many action movie conventions in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc the musical score resembles david michael frank s score for hard to kill which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie there is plenty of martial arts in the film and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up and i have to admit i was mildly entertained lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early s but he is certainly no action star that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters my recommendation is that you skip cia codename alexa and check out la femme nikita instead 
i don t understand how of us receive such a high rating i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble however i did like jared harris performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted hours 
lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers o j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit i m not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to o j simpson and lamas comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jean claude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o j simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldn t escape this movie in you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic out of bad 
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa oj simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona translation cable tv filler there isn t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure the script has some gaping holes best worst moment in one jarring scene oj s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose now that s a guilty pleasure bc
as an impressionable year old i liked the love conquers all philosophy of the s sitcom bridget loves bernie i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david birney and an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter and both sets of parents harold j stone and bibi osterwald as bernie s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget s parents who have issues with the young couple s interfaith marriage looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highly rated season created by veteran tv writer bernard slade who a few years after the show s cancellation would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight there was no denying the real life chemistry between birney and baxter but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects birney in his short lived role in st elsewhere and baxter in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered 
this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing 
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been the bad i m a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and that s too bad you can tell things aren t right with the story i couldn t get involved with treat williams portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasn t in this movie it s also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy too not everything was disappointing i can t complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona i d like to see this movie re made and done better because it is a one of a kind story 
i can t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity there s something about mary leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loser not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid the bonus is from the one time i smiled it s not like i m immune to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw rush hour and laughed ourselves silly this movie just stunk 
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn t mean it is a terrorist thing it also show s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn t mean we are all bad we just try to live day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying we ll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don t usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name 
up until this new season i have been a big little mosque fan however the new season had absolutely ruined it the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any more just cancel it and be done with it it s not worth watching any more it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be made bring back the old format 
who likes awful comedy shows like little mosque on the prairie the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one muslims and self proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn t even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not two old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable badly written stale jokes cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left i d be curious who even writes for this show do you think it s actually muslims or hip funny young people no i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the s when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are air farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness but we still have lame ducks like this hour has minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for not to mention this poor excuse for comedy little mosque on the prairie it is supposed to be offencive and funny only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching 
unlike many i don t find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive its execution however is another matter entirely like so many b minus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers for most of the or so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late night infomercial but not a primetime sitcom even a canadian one notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas unfortunately they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the prairies the final insult is that they apparently couldn t even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town why are they so hard to find in saskatchewan did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world primed by the cbc s publicists quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom 
this movie is one long chiche after another first of all though they did their share there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot the wigs and accents are terrible they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons john is the nasty envious closet homosexual slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the two of us john would not have been mean to his fans like this either like his death showed us he was too nice if anything the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul s yesterday an insulted john says something along the lines of sure and while i croon why don t you get down on your knees put on your wife s wig and lick my liggin that made me laugh for days really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here forget it 
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the show s creator on the bbc world today a show that is broadcast all over the world unfortunately this show doesn t even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one dimensional the acting is well mediocre i m being nice it s the classic cbc recipe one that always fails if you re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if you re white you d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem most of the better comedies are rooted in that it s only a problem when it isn t funny as in this show canada is bursting with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldn t find any 
this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i don t know a single person who likes this show and can t stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it won t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show 
if you re looking to be either offended or amused or both you ll probably have to look elsewhere lmotp really isn t even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clich s at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it s just another lame innocuous and anti septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing and once the zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it s so shallow when judged on its merits alone unless you re obsessed with muslim culture in the west and or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don t see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural ethnic dichotomy in western multi ethnic societies lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight 
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he s a pretty good actor i only see him getting better it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don t really care to watch another episode i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities 
little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for cbc means year old farmers in saskatchewan the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can t believe it the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has minutes royal canadian air farce and rick mercer s report 
this series just gets worse and worse poorly written and just plain not funny the premise is excellent but the writer s inexperience shines through by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren t we zany isn t this funny well no it s not actually gum disease is less painful no wonder with the exception of corner gas canadians generally avoid canadian tv come on cbc you re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent pull the plug on this amateurish mess 
once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses but not minutes it s called beating a dead horse even snl would know to give up after a commercial break also let s have a little conflict in these scripts will she or won t she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan when will ramadan start ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here and the characters what characters they are all cardboard cut outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next that s the point of the situation comedy we need to have strong interesting dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they re going to get into next week if i never see these characters it ll be too soon thankfully i can t remember any of their names note to cbc that s not a good sign and the acting is so bland it s more so a problem in casting than in the actors none of these people actually embody the characters they play they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character make us fall in love with them where they become inseparable from the character the portray watch any american sitcom and you ll see how easily identifiable characters are part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next years portraying that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows but to be honest considering the lame concept and the horrible writing there s not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture as another commenter mentions this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom and the directing or lack there of what can i say canada has so much talent look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up look at the trailer park boys not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that s where many of our stars go to find decent work give credit to the cbc they really know how to build publicity for a non event remember the one no well don t even try to learn any characters names in this show as it s sure to go the way of the dodo let s all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while 
this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news sports or satirical sketch comedy as a developer of situation comedy cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of king of kensington with the belly laughs of the beachcombers it is an embarrassment to great shows like kids in the hall and second city that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production i have to admit that i didn t give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept to start half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom successes in english canadian history corner gas the rest of the concept the cultural clash is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical but comes off as forced some of the jokes that are based around the local s reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved especially the audience this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn t get it when it comes to creating canadian content especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy handed and forced way it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas i e the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines more realistically their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics that being said even as a formulaic fish out of water comedy this show fails the acting is weak the comic pacing all over the map and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief even for a comedy the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath who is horribly wasted here i doubt that even the addition of guest stars colin mochrie for example as an anglican archbishop can save this dog i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc s hype had died down but two episodes were all i could stand i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline the time slot would be better served by airing more coronation street air farce re runs or dr who even an infomercial would be an improvement 
i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show can t be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future 
i m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i m thinking matrix i m thinking bladerunner i m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we ll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact 
while i have never been a fan of the original scooby doo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna barbera without a doubt scrappy doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby doo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is preferable the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nerves and this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the live action scooby doo movie they made the villain scrappy doo since practically everyone hates him 
wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn t deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money 
god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i m a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron 
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound i rated it so high b c there aren t any negative scores in the imdb com rating system zaphoid ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it s called an indirect proportionality quality star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less z
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn t sleep the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don t screw with it azjazz
a story of amazing disinterest kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting as is fulci s mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found it s padded out to an insufferable degree by the end you won t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom and like me maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep jennifer o neill s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie fulci gorehounds beware there s just not much going on in the psychic 
average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it s still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance the genre s well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair fulci s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look out of limping killers
i was really disappointed in this movie those that voted this thing a have a screw lose the acting was ok kinda wooden and cardboard the ending was sorry i just didn t care for this at all no way could i recommend this mess 
man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy now most of the rest of the film was okay it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others the problem isn t with direction acting or anything technical the movie is just destroyed in the third act why the murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history for all the complaints about burton s planet of the apes the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever what a let down 
this movie is just plain dumb from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability mike hammer is one of detective fiction s true sociopaths unlike marlow and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book velda s dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she s way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however precedes the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 
how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face that s how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some retard drugged out screen writer that s how 
i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck talespin peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are good don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally don t mind scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the catchphrase puppy power scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didn t feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo get a clue but this show is disappointing for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids bethany cox
this is one of the worst films i ve ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn t i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the th century i don t think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice 
i rented this movie from the library it s hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity i m a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment the bell jar is by far one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the script is horrible not because it strays from the original novel text but because it strays without focus or intent the scenes are ill constructed and don t lead the viewer anywhere what s with the hokey voice over of plath s poetry lady lazarus has little do with greenwood s situation plath s poetry was completely misused marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood or any year old for that matter partly due to casting she was during filming the age plath was when she died and partly due to the fact that she can t act hassett is all emotion no craft no skill the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what s there which isn t much the only reason i m giving the film a is because isn t an option sorry sylvia you ll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting 
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen s most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry peerce s direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think it s the former and his self centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don t like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my all time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy 
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the s this show quack pack shouldn t even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales it s about a teen aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg there s no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales 
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw first the adults did not age when the children did for years several parts of the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the years passed the copy i saw was missing about minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared it is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired bergman russell both did fine in the film in their roles it is a shame the large chunk is missing but what is here is watchable i just wish it was all intact the script makes little sense in that bergman s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults some of the time lines don t make sense either there is a stock market crash that resembles but the kids grow up to fight in world war all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine just wonder what was in the gap of film i could not see as it was missing 
by columbia was a full fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or warners that s the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman top billed for the first time in an american film and warner baxter bergman plays a frenchwoman this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to baxter s four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stock market crash of until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so goody good it s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through she s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later 
you d think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain addled the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family everything is so very peachy and swell the family adores bergman and things couldn t be more perfect well that is until the mother fay wray dies the stock market crashes in wiping out the family s fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not bad later after the family s fortunes have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isn t really a conceivable reason why they d hire her once again as a governess but briefly everything is swell once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to war gosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward miss hayward s character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell she s obviously a horny she devil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war now here is where the movie gets really really dumb brain achingly dumb hayward begins an affair with one of david s brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not hayward with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter snipe once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad and most likely did the same to the audiences back in the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward s evilness to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut hayward the film suffers because of poor writing hayward s affair made no sense at least in how it was handled and having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken 
i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr s character like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things that s susan hayward s job here in one of her earliest prominent roles hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son has an affair with another and starts making a play for the third it s an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays everyone is afraid to tell father what s going on the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman here s where the plot gets a little silly bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business bergman has to be let go she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up i m sorry but i can t believe the kids need a governess now hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn t the kids who brought her back in the normal course of things bergman would have gotten on with her life one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have it s too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons and i m willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor 
i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever i didn t realize it was disney until it was too late i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story it was as if someone made a movie out of a th grader s book report on the novel meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses mrs murray meg s mother was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet and that s just the beginning by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn t read the book i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright 
first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine l engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a wrinkle in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine l engle pictured meg to be at all in fact meg was based on madeleine s character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l engle and her wrinkle in time series i would suggest skipping this movie 
after the success of scooby doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scooby doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappy doo it was scrappy doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby doo doesn t need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scooby doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it 
we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l engle s fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you i m not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a made for t v movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script after all the star wars spin off ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if i d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite star turned mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow that s right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight year old the majestic half man half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tear inducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become a jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didn t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat nosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad it s the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people even madeleine l engle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was ugly score if i could pros they got the names right cons it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn t even bother to photoshop meg s arm on properly 
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn t even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i can t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you ve ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done 
i only recently found out that madeleine l engle s novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel the murry family is well cast with a likable if too pretty meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating the first half hour is promising enough doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene unfortunately as soon as the non human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive she must have visited faye dunaway s plastic surgeon in recent years for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction i understand that this is a tv movie but the cgi looked like something that could have been done years earlier mrs whatsits centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast who in the novel is a velvety elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here i could go on and on nearly every artistic choice is a disaster presumably because there wasn t a large enough budget to do this justice but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children s literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it s sequels for the big screen giving it the scope it deserves 
i have never read the book a wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn t be reviewing this movie i ll start off with that next i ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlin how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i ll just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodard or woodward i am not sure the oscar winner the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it s a tv movie they usually aren t good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you ll most likely forget about it the second it s over well maybe not the second it s over but within a few minutes a wrinkle in time 
i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie having fond memories of the book as a child i decided to check this out this is a movie that you should really pass on it is just not worth seeing it is very boring and uninteresting i feel that it would even be that way to small children it has no magic that the book contains this movie is not horrible but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it there are moments that just come off as weird the witch character is not very good the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening i know this is a kids movie so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix i really didn t care how it finished skip this film and read the book instead 
i have loved this book since my th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago and i have read it to every one of my rd and th grade classes over my past years of teaching supposedly a movie had been made in the past but i d never been able to locate it well my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l engle s excellent book to the screen as i watched the movie i had the highest of hopes as the film went on i became more and more despondent they had botched it badly never had i been so let down by a favorite book to film adaption i understand that films can t stick strictly to a book but they don t need to change things for the sake of it most if not all of departures from the book were totally unnecessary i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie well it wasn t just me nearly every single one felt the same way cheated out of the great story that madeline l engle had so skillfully created why they wondered did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie why couldn t calvin s hair have been red why did mrs which not have the proper witch like outfit that was such a clever play on her name basically we all wondered why did nearly every single detail have to be changed i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make i am still waiting for that movie this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses i m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task 
 this may be a bit on the spoilerish side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney made for tv movie a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago it s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults plus it s got built in quality sequels but disney fying was not the way to go the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book it is a complicated and emotional story for kids there was no reason to make charles wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs w s as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that there was no reason to remove meg s glasses that deprived us of what could ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book i could nitpick for days about little things but i also think larger things like the art direction was a off take for instance the way they made camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth it looks like earth it has people on it that look like humans the skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing but something is a little bit off the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth that is if we forget how to love it would ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm i unfortunately did not watch the end maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well overall an artistic disappointment 
i really didn t like this movie because it didn t really bring across the messages and ideas l engle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i m afraid i can t say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l engle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don t see this movie if you are a big fan of l engle s texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie 
i have read the whole a wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was pages and the film was hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find meg s father and get off the island camazotz the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations aren t necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straight to video acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a but sadly i can only give it a half could have been useful 
the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek l engle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it is i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind 
horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props would ve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie what a waste starting from the name of the movie the enemy naming it action movie would ve made it better contributing to the parody effect the cop looking like a year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie horrible don t waste your time 
i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didn t seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasn t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didn t explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you haven t read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might entice you to read the book which you ll probably enjoy more 
this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l engle s work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuar n makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience 
disney what happened i really wish the movie had been set in the s like the book was and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption i m glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books but the man with red eyes interchangeable as it and what s up with the volcanic upheaval where was that in the book peter jackson save us a long time ago i heard that there was european version of this film i sure wish i could id it i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption this movie needs to be x d 
i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can t you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild 
the book is so good that at least the opening of this made for tv movie will move you but then as it diverges more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches it becomes boring still from comments i ve heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins uncle albert i love to laugh nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny 
awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock stick some b stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didn t have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with sh and ends with it horrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak it s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie it s a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future investors it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious time don t bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back 
these were over minutes of semi unexpected boredom first i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that then reaching th minute i was convincing myself that it s only a few more minutes and i lasted to the very end which i m kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human s patience and crap tolerance was it worth watching at all well as i wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if you re strong willed enough you may even last to the end the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all all happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel 
this movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable it was very low budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video it wasn t even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the hours back the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing what a stretch skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this ejames 
this movie is such a bad work nothing seems to even try and be realistic plot is weak acting miserable actors wondering around like in a st year production trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning what a flop what a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood just imagine someone who minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a whistle as if slashing one s throat is done by a virtual agent also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat did she ask him politely to bend down for her much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager hungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virgin bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area asking for guidance to scenery spots not a word about last night such a waste of time even to try and write about this low low supposed to be movie 
as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face talk about insulting i was writing better stories than this in th grade bad acting bad writing bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time who would green light something so poorly written it s not artistic clever smart suspenseful mysterious scary dramatic nothing the characters are flat and boring with no development the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next pulp fiction this script should have been used to line a bird cage not a movie oh and last but not least a lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std 
ho hum an inventor s horst buchholz deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands unknowingly his son luke perry has been working on the antedote all along enter cia agent olivia d abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins also in the cast are tom conti hendrick haese and an aging roger moore moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts perry fans will be accepting d abo is wrong for the role but nice to look at 
i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie really unhappily i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it especially when it s such a classic or what people use to call a classic i think that this is one of those movies every movie lover should have watched at least one time so that was why i watched it don t get me wrong i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion no really good plot neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story well not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether bogey and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another i think to have and have not is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the s 
or marlowe at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey quite talky too bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male i e alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo but he is only a fat alpha male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clich s are all here bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic about to reform as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him it doesn t so he can t be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a well meaning humanitarian i don t think so bacall does her non chalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not all too interesting so called sexual innuendo exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today s standards just purse your lips and whistle a load of crap she was when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland the cuteness of a myrna loy let alone the likability of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femme fatales in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers but my fast forward button was ready if you re interested in reading my biographies of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by e mail 
i enjoyed the first reviewer s comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second run theatre in the early s i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings but to me the cast was largely squandered their personalities muffled by the masks while the direction i think of as being unusually static and the photography murky the rating jotted down at the time was a nought which means not worth sitting through even once still i too would jump at a chance to have a second look 
this is one of those films that i could only sit through once charlotte henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects granted this was but it really creaked part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen gary cooper w c fields and cary grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming the movie just clumped along with no cohesion much of lewis carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing what a pity it s such a great book i would recommend disney s version 
a family moves into a old house in japan but there s a catch it s haunted boo aw didn t mean to make you jump it s only a review settle back down ahem now anyways it s haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife her lover in slow motion this naturally makes a minutes scene stretch out to about or horrid acting horrid story but how bad can it be you ask well it was so bad my brain started to melt leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder yes i know doug was in out of this world not small wonder but it s pretty much the same damn show i can hum the small wonder theme better there are movies that are so bad they re good this isn t one of those where i saw it showtime beyond my grade f eye candy mako hattori gets topless susan george gets love scenes one nude one just topless 
this is a rotten movie the cast seem to know just how bad it was it starts badly and by the end is truly bad the acting is woeful the script could of been written on the spot and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes crap out of 
i saw this film at a pre release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the film s producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reaction many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film if the audience wasn t scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they d re cut it as far as i can tell they hadn t it was the same lousy movie just a year older it almost qualifies as so bad it s good but it s slow paced and boring 
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i can t imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie 
while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic i m not even sure where to begin as i ve got so many problems with this movie i suppose i ll just number a few of them the acting when you see that edward albert doug mcclure and susan george and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know you re in trouble not that it matters much to me but these are hardly a list names susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy but i ve never considered her the greatest actress i ve ever seen and in this movie her acting is embarrassing as for the other two the less said the better the ghosts the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disney world and they are about as frightening and why did they have to be so obvious subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells the plot how predictable can one movie be the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters if you couldn t see where this movie was headed after about minutes you need to see more movies the convenient priest what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits absurd is a word that comes to mind everything else it s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about i suppose i ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house s architecture that s a sure sign of a winner noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn t say much about the actual movie i ll stop you should be able to get the idea from what i ve already mentioned and i haven t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems be warned this thing is horrible 
film starts in japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide it s a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present day well to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby s work they rent a house and surprise surprise it just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the family sounds ok but it s really hopeless there s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious they look so fake i swear i saw the strings pulling one along and they re muttering there s a pointless sex sequence in the first minutes probably just to show off george s body another one about minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed as for acting albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but george as always is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift but can t save it i m giving this a just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film 
that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn t pick up someone s camcorder second indie films are supposed to be about real people there s nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely human what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is sorry but this is not good writing or good directing what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand 
i don t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it s over if you were ever scared this doesn t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn t tack on one of those happy endings story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto japan so that ted fletcher edward albert can write a book and he brings along his wife laura susan george and their daughter amy amy barrett their friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted about years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher s arrive it doesn t take long before strange things start happening spoiler alert at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair meanwhile ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help unfortunately the ghosts get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happened years earlier this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked first it doesn t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts secondly it has susan george in the cast i ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it s one of the reasons why she was so popular but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically this isn t a bad film but it s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career 
dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned the monk recounts the history of the house which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence and then the film simply cuts away to something else earlier the monk had offered to help well where is the help the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier try to drive the spirits out of the house although by this time it s difficult for the viewers to care there are some probably unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director s motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing but on the whole this is a forgettable dud 
the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads kushiata kyoto japan a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori toshiya maruyama walks up the winding path to the house inside waits otami mako hattori with whom he is having an affair behind her husband shugoro s tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki back who happens to be masanori s teacher shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide over a century later and ted fletcher edward albert arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura susan george and their young daughter amy amy barrett their close friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay you don t need me to you where he jokingly says it s going so cheap because it s haunted to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don t believe in ghosts at least for the time being that is almost immediately the film goes into clich mode lights turn on and off by themselves laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk henry mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it s too late which they ignore of course the spirits of otami masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches tsuyako olajima curse put upon them but there may be a way they can break the curse unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage daughter and possibly even their very lives directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film ok to watch once if you ve got nothing better to do but after a day or two you ll probably have completely forgotten it nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there s nothing particularly good about the film either the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by the numbers a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn t help things there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter noriko mayumi umeda and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in some exorcism one more thing i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was when he made this try his hand at kung fu and oriental sword fighting george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there s no blood gore or violence to speak about the transparent ghost effects are ok but they ain t going to impress many people these days it s professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america england or any western country without having to change a thing an ok time waster 
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don t take it seriously it is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable there are giant crabs that attack a girl oh and the crabs sing japanese it is amazingly bad and the ending which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat don t even give this film a chance and you will love it susan george is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked her daughter isn t quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant crabs they are the size of large cats this is a but i love it as a movie my god but for entertainment i give it a did i mention there are giant crabs 
 it s this one very cool premise right off the bat has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credit s due has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it looked the only thing was the ghost s relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene you d think their dynamic would be different things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt and the crab spider scene was just not good but then the ending is actually very good sure the grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai s and that s what i liked about this movie comparatively please someone one with a tempered style remake this movie fans of silent rage would absolutely love this movie 
at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis a couple of times but no worries it s not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let s start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it s not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you ll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter s bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba 
this could have been interesting a japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly installed american family but falls flat due to an over simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they re expected to besides it doesn t deliver much in the scares department a giant crab attack is merely silly as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomat friend of the family doug mcclure and edward albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there eventually he s called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time waster tolerable at just minutes but in no way essential viewing 
giant crabs cursing in japanese what was in that drink a terrible movie but laughable i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around drink much beer before you see this movie 
from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get ragged on a lot but i didn t think it was that bad i ve seen much worse actually the house where evil dwells is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on re enacting the bloody murder that took place years back i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but i ve seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little over done we get to see the translucent blue tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ju on the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity curses put on the home etc but i may be wrong to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story don t go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 
director kevin connor and wannabe action hero romantic lead doug mcclure re team in this ghost story set in japan they had been moderately successful together in the s with the likes of the land that time forgot at the earth s core etc without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way the film begins with a prologue set in the th century with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted laura visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place no surprises as to what happens next with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex mcclure assuming the role of the wife s lover everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant to an inevitable but surprisingly downbeat conclusion main points of interest are two feeble decapitations the omen has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set piece and the love making scenes featuring the doe eyed but extremely kinky susan george the first is a long don t look now inspired piece with her hubby complete with piano music the second a much shorter probably at her insistence entanglement with mcclure both looking pretty uncomfortable anyway every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost overall i can t decide whether the house where evil dwells is rubbish watchable rubbish or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way if you re not into the genre there is nothing here at all but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort best scene in any other film the big black tree climbing japanese muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is to be told beef and vegetable before uttering the immortal line ugh there s an awful face in my soup if this wasn t enough the reply is c mon eat your soup for daddy laurel hardy rest in piece 
raising victor vargas is just a bad film no amount of denial or ad dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact maybe peter sollett saw he didn t have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy film making maybe he just doesn t know any better it s hard to tell what s not hard to tell is the result except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film making into an attempt at pseudo realism few will enjoy it i know i didn t do yourselves a favor and pass on this film 
i just rented and watched this movie just to see what s all the fuss about so here s what my reactions to it are it s easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesn t shock or disturb me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily shortened to under minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i don t know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot here s a list on top of my mind why don t the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent time why don t they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer s ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldn t send a coward imbecile to do the job why didn t jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most people s mind especially for someone who is a writer why didn t these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoiler but hey this movie is not without its merits camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer `why me why me i didn t even c^m 
i ve seen the gator bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but that s only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience s need to see this woman seek revenge this is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but i was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a t a film b movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b movie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot on the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists these men are evolutionary drop outs just like they were in the gator bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply satisfies the audience s desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much but it is by far the most painful to watch we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with spoilers you know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed the woman does not live happily ever after she doesn t write her book she doesn t leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks but hey what more did you expect oh and did you read the tagline if you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned i was really looking forward to those 
i m not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there s almost no plot anyway i ve seen several reviewers call isoyg an anti rape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie that s right a shapely woman s behind whether it was zarchi s attempt to make an anti rape statement and i absolutely don t believe it was is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it the rape s in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch there s something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before he s murdered so the scene isn t at all engaging on an emotional level really it s just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowd finally a few reviewers have commended zarchi s so called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn caliber actors do their thing i m not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg i m all for exploitation horror and love video nasties in fact i m giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however it s also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho hum mostly gore less murders and wait for the credits to roll this is probably worth watching once if you re a hardcore s exploitation fan but i m telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation

with knightly and o tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or not the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements 
quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were given so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer s wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won t speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimer s breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the list there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased 
being a filmmaker myself and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour i thought i was in for a treat when i took home my wrongs not that the dvd cover gives anything away instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director chris morris a short film including scenes i should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of twoddle the scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with morris s warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series brass eye and serves no purpose other than to shock how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand the runner s commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself it s often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here instead we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs this is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled its over simplified message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated the film does have its moments of pseudo kafkaesque surrealism but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to enlighten and just ends up being irritating if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking i strongly recommend franz kafka s it s a wonderful life by peter capaldi 
simply not the quality i expected from morris love brass eye and blue jam this is very much like a not so bad student film what concerns me in all this is why did it win a bafta morris makes fun of enshrined mediocrity ayn rand in much of his work nathan barley and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle the humanity of terrorism four lions that he isn t going to cock that up wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena 
there s nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets it s just that some are better than others this is very poor the acting is awful the script dire and the special effects overrated why does hollywood treat it s audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel 
one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they the yuppies are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies 
this film is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as direction which this film needed in droves not that the writing was all the wonderful rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way the pseudo documentary style prized by those who don t know how to direct this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don t know the first thing about film making which is most of them just terrible it says a lot about sundance and what it s become that victor vargas was showcased there 
without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clich d films i ve ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap i bought this for but remember you can t put a price on minutes of your life you d do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price 
enough is enough sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead the first tremors movie was great the second one was ridiculous the third one was nauseating the tv series was depressingly awful and this movie just drives the stake deeper basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the wild west in the s and they fight graboids like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again mildly entertaining i suppose otherwise this straight to video release just like tremors and is just going way too far oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event i think something like this would be history making so our pals in the first film wouldn t be so unprepared movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy avoid this garbage 
dear dear dear dear dear me i had the strength to see it through but why the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing this was some kind of tremors for kids i can t believe this movie was made at all seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with it what audience is this movie for i can only think of year olds if you re older than you ll have serious problems with this movie it s not only slow but it s so utterly boring the characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped it s fun for a while but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen you know everything that is going to happen too cause yes you ve seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced it s so bad so wrong so crap but ok we did get a laugh now and then not just at the silly plot holes but some scenes where worth a replay or two or one scene that is where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys it s really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly still makes me grin when i think about it but that only happened one more time sadly and that s when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully that and one comment they spring from the ground like some demonic trout at this point we where almost crying with laughter but after that nothing could ever top that so it s pretty much downhill from there so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie he s either a plant vegetable or someone very evil this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far looking forward to seeing tremors it s bound to be box office hit compared to this this goosebumps no i ll leave it at that 
well tremors i the original started off in and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we re from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well 
just a few words this movie really sucks it s like those tv movies with bad cast and plot it s amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii don t waste your time watching this crap even if you like the tremors movies 
this the direct to video death rattle of the tremors series features sixty inspired seconds sawblade you ll know it when you see it and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at tremors was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm on human violence tops the lackluster cliche spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through much less enjoy this film if you aren t among them don t bother 
the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the present day tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the ever returning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot em up some dirt dragons this one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past it s like a western with miniature versions of the original film s monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didn t brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing tremors the legend begins s s wilson michael gross brent roam billy drago
warning this review contains minor spoilers well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas i m a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the graboids due to the relative lack of graboids through the first minutes i m convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isn t one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago s character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the nd and rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer whenever there wasn t any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and or watch however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute on the plus side when the graboids dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets i was impressed when i saw that tremors was listed at minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it i m sure that this movie is a good minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn t further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the script i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors packaged for sale with tremors what luck i thought pay for get for free well after watching tremors i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i can t imagine paying a single dime for tremors for fans of the series it s best to forget that tremors the legend begins even exists tremors the legend begins rates a out of 
i found tremors the legend begins to be dull and boring all the action scenes were stupid the so called graboids are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat if not smaller the acting was horrendous and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed the story is so dumb and useless also if you want to tell a story way back in time make sure you use the same actor michael gross to be someone in the past when he s someone in the present in the other tremor movies geez if you haven t seen this film don t waste your time stick to tremors and for a good time this film however make sure you re remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense 
if fassbinder has made a worse film i sure don t want to see it anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like the bitter tears of petra von kant this film bogs down with so much arty quasi symbolic images it looks like a parody of an art film the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira s prostitute friend channel surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer s endurance but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex wife and or her daughter these are the only moments that display any real human emotion and prove that at the core of this horrible film there was an excellent film struggling to free itself what a waste 
as if the storyline wasn t depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then there s the core premise of the hero heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he s besot ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didn t get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but it s really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really 
i can t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long long time in a no budget way it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck this film should be avoided at all costs it s one of those festival films that only please the pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore good bad film making is not different it s just bad film making 
this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin elvira suicides at the end but instead of this in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young this happened and he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there etc soon in the movie erwin elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat and while telling her the story of elvira s life fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of i have suffered much in my life and am about to die in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something erwin elvira encounters a former lover that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he recognizes elvira there are some interesting shots and ideas i must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder s self indulgence 
it s funny i ve seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are repellent and self indulgent messes like this film for me it ranges from great to crap without much in the middle i know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but i can t help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype from my point of view and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too self indulgent his gay or gender bending films like this one tend to be really bad sloppily done sometimes quite boring such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant and sometimes just gross like this film couldn t his message about acceptance of a person s gender confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic then maybe i d care about the films i m honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films the bad seems to be out weighing the good 
this film is in the mandingo drum type they were both dreadful but they are better than this tripe badly acted made oliver reed is the main name eartha kitt also is in it tis a pity rating is about as low as yu can get as always jay harris
there are no reasons to watch this movie should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life s every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill like that would ever happen then get this movie from the video shop if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk go figure but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie claudia udy showing her chest sadly no other reason than that 
this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he s noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but he s hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they re is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they re turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there s the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton s lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel 
 stars out of a possible and that is being overly generous i thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas how could it miss i was wrong i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week end he cranked out this piece of dribble i d long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms it this is the kind of artsy b s that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie you haven t seen dysfunctional families until you ve seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughter in addition to the above as if that weren t enough the plot and it s so thin you could read thorough it has a hole in it the size of alaska ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i don t claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work not that anything else was really working anyway the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i can t imagine why anyone would want to 
before seeing this movie i would ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now it s everything minus one james woods is pathetic not his character his acting someone should ve told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche ditto for randy quaid s stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isn t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess if you enjoy the country you ll enjoy the scenery that s the best i can give it i m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible 
this would ve been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i m doing really big acting sort of way everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldn t tear my eyes away this dialogue might ve worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace this script must ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn t character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that s a plot contrivance stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me i m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory don t say you weren t warned 
this is not a children s movie this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of for a month my year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn t the worst of it we stopped it about a hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear 
probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this they might not have read the book they might enjoy gore and violence in a film they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here the only thing i liked about this film is the song bright eyes if perchance you happen to be one of those people who has read the book enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence you are sure not to like this otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this like in the book a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come only a few rabbits including his brother hazel believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live 
how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too many raising victor vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent production it s supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose it s edgy so let s not waste any time lighting the film it s hip so let s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface and so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won t impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film 
ok i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a classic and a standard part of most people s childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of i must admit i really hated it we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words watership down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it to be honest i wish i hadn t bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don t like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull this film was possibly the slowest thing i ve ever watched imagine a doped up snail in space and really didn t do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced i m not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get gassed not because i m a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh i m so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimax if i were to praise it in any way i d have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well meaning maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message it s trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad too so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldn t watch it the whole way through or i d probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isn t torque bad but it still doesn t rate highly in my eyes so i ve given it a hope this helps 
i saw this movie as a very young girl i m now and it scared me witless for years i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it i am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it s a classic and it is really a great story however i don t think that it should have been made into a cartoon ever well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way gives me a little heart palpitation every time yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there 
firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn t believe how gory it was for a children s movie bunnies being brutally murdered it s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over to see this but don t get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn t scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a let s say year old child to watch this it s just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i m wayy over and i was shocked by the violence i don t recommend
so it s really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck 
i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don t like the story line just a personal preference thank you
this movie is great mind you but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly snobby and small minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i don t think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting much of what we see might have been normal for the times people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority i can t have our child living this way spare me this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of hogwash 
i hate this movie it is a horrid movie sean young s character is completely unsympathetic her performance is wooden at best the storyline is completely predictable and completely uninteresting i would never recommend this film to anyone it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see 
well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i don t know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she s still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i can t agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it s by no means the worst of its type you ll ever see and unlike the recent eyes wide shut at least something happens in this one 
did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last oh my god it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can t understand why i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought no they would never do that that s far too lame i can hardly stand it i feel so unsatisfied i think i m about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own someone please change my mind i want to love this so bad someone tell me why i m wrong great show terrible ending 
the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed it s funny the producers even admitted they didn t have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didn t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn t really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didn t happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb 
first of all write the script on a napkin who needs more than that after all we re not a hollywood film then get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years honing their craft then hire a cinematographer who doesn t know how to light you see if it s well lit it won t look real and the festival people won t like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a ten year old who has never held a camera to be your operator it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small sliver of the audience who over intellectualize will scream genius because they won t believe this was just complete amateur hour once you ve done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance what a sad waste 
there are many good things about the new bsg there s the multiple cylon roles for model and for example which the two actresses played superbly there s the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica my ship will not be networked over my dead body also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned sci fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all the darkness of the characters their essentially flawed nature that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the cylons and all that was very good but the mushy ending i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more every frakking character got its complete ending that wasn t really necessary what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupil student what does that bring to the story where was the linkage now i m all for a more european ish style approach and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous this didn t bring anything meaningful to the story also i ve seen the last frakkin special and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldn t come up with a good ending for the story so he just didn t it s never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the mitochondrial eve thing was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h g storyline and speaking of hera now there s a storyline that was not worked out well at all instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who s years younger don t get me wrong i m all for older women with younger men the more power to them but this just made no sense all in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be that goes even moreso for the last episode i hope lost and do better with their series finales 
i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle pegasus third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the cylon plan why were there two cylon factions what was the point of angel kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth what kind of a past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations questions everywhere answers nowhere and then comes the end earth our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paper thinly across the planet that s not only anti science it s anti reason and anti life and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a i that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction and don t even get me started on the angels religious claptrap of the worst kind the ultimate disappointment the whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius frakkin shame out of 
horrible ending and i can t believe moore spent a year coming up with it smacks of l ron hubbard and dianetitcs which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first years now the first hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it deteriorated into a slow painful sophomoric dissolution of the series unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was were we to think more deeply if i wanted a lesson in a materialism i would reread daniel quinn s ishmael absurd to think k people would give up everything for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappearing kara and a reappearing baltar and six absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve just absurd 
the fight scenes were great loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side it was the ending that i hated i was disappointed that it was earth but k years back but to travel all that way just to start over are you kidding me k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise they abandon technology no way sure they were eating paper and rationing food but that is over they can live like humans again they only have one good doctor what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth yea right no one would have made that choice 
did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can t think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth why baltar has an imaginary in his head why has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don t explain it at all the plot of the last episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he d attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew s lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters lives before the war it s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread the word forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken wouldn t 
with these people faking so many shots using old footage and gassing animals to get them out not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors what s to believe old film of countries is nice but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films i know racism is ok in these old films but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility portrayed as fliers they never flew their planes martin johnson was an ex vaudevillian used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties denying his wife s apparent depression using her as a cute prop all this makes these films unbearable they were by no means the first to travel to these lands or the first to write about them he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer but that s about it 
the s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or high priced movie stars the most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of martin e johnson and his wife osa who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in africa and asia the johnsons safari films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably wheeler woolsey s so this is africa in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs johnson martini instead of martin e johnson geddit although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time the johnsons films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour viewed from our own more enlightened i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the johnsons documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co produced with her husband congorilla is probably the best of the johnsons films the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the johnsons penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look wild and alien the best and funniest scene in congorilla is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women the dance is the black bottom no less the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton the conjoined twins wearing jodhpurs riding boots and a pith helmet osa johnson starts scat singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish it s a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm i guess because it s in their blood or something i ll rate congorilla points out of this film says a little bit about african life in the s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade 
admirably odd though mean spirited comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome robert altman directed quasi comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight some of the cinematography is evocative shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort s vision of a mother bird imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her in the lead bud cort is once again after harold maude a true original not off putting like say michael j pollard cort manages to be geeky wacky and inoffensive a tough act to pull off unfortunately this is one of altman s misfires he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward from 
the movie sucked it wasn t funny it wasn t exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking it s cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a success the fact that at this moment voted a out of for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising it s success can only be described as a marketing marvel 
i d like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie i ve ever seen i have no idea what s wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people must ve voted during one or more conditions while being shitfaced stoned out of their minds they ve received hard cash for the votes under gunpoint i can t believe i wasted a good h min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie 
what a bad bad film i can t believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film making than anything else avoid at all costs you ll want your time back i know i did 
unless you are between the ages of and except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly that s it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left i m so glad i did not pay for this despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even so bad it s good material i m _very_ tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthy no this piece of over cgi d rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes of 
i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started taking over the plane at first i thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that this movie isn t worth a trip to blockbuster be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb ass if you want to be really scared i suggest the descent if you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash 
all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you re looking for something that s funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog 
i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn t even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun it s easy to understand that soap realizes it s a piece of s it and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense it s the worst kind of lame movie it s joyless 
the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasn t expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie that s pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called turbulence yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and it s not even the apporiate title for the movie the wasn t even a glimpse of snake or plane minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasn t for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg level you know what s really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake 
this must be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can t say i m picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can t think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute 
b movie at best sound effects are pretty good lame concept decent execution i suppose it s a rental you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen you gonna be ok tommy you stay by the airphone when agent harris calls you get me give me a fire extinguisher weapons we need weapons where s the silverware all we have is this sporks dr price is the snake expert local ers can handle the occasional snakebite alert every er in the tri city area 
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone s been fixing the score either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that s about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo types to sum it up it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen stay away 
oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but it s not even good cheese it s the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunk stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up for a few laughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film s expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesn t even qualify as a so bad it s good movie it s just plain bad very very bad here s why look away if you re spoilerphobic the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you don t want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra evil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish i e hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that he d watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot hole related questions was explained in the minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact i m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didn t hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit inducing hour the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes i ll just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is snakes yay oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead before any snakes even appear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans that s an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that we ve met the cast let s watch all of them die except of course the cute kids don t expect anything original it s just snake bites on various and ever increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film makers obviously didn t use theirs so that s most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice cool sammy included but wait we re not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jackson s hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much needed u turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience years ago let alone in would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the film actually we re not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia it s time for good guy and hero to get it on in bali nope it wasn t at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times that s it this is the first time i ve ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel l jackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please don t see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you ll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united instead that was good 
this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it s production the audience became the film makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend how is it possible to be objective this is our movie isn t it or is it there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film maker who promotes himself as the audience s friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them just look at that prime self publicist eli roth promising gore hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like hostel david r ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it he took the carnival huckster school of film making to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy so many have enthused over this interactive democratic approach to film making that they seem to have missed the point that this is the most cynical form of film as marketing nothing is included that the film makers know the fans won t buy and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know isn t this just the evolution of the focus group approach individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses it s a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don t make for good movies why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different because we happen to be film fans well thank god for us because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake so yes i had fun at the movie a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice cream but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere like christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what there was laughter but i don t know if it was with the film or at the film with a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction there are some genuinely good aspects to the film samuel l jackson gives a well judged performance pure self parody but with a real sense of pleasure rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate the stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isn t what s the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there s no creeping menace there are several snake jumps out moments but they re incredibly badly staged only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene the other killings are oddly flat the demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched most of the actors fail to make an impression it s a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller coaster she could be talking to the audience the film falls far short there are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with lake placid and it s as apt a contrast as any i can think of that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasn t devised by committee that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus i don t need a post pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film this film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history if it sets a precedent however i m genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time in all probability nothing much will come of it perennial popcorn favourites raiders of the lost ark alien halloween and of course star wars just aren t produced by group think in the mean time i ll tell you what i haven t half got a craving for some ingmar bergman 
 raising victor vargas is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the n y times crossword puzzle at the same time and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona you don t have to pause the dvd just let it roll cause you won t be missing anything really important no twists turns or tension it s not really an ethnic movie it s a movie about a poor struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino they could have been any ethnic group it made very little difference i ve seen it all a zillion times before just plug in a jewish family an italian family a black family or an irish family just the accents and names were different if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians the movie would have been a total snooze it s funny that the critics here couldn t get the locale straight some said it was spanish harlem some the bronx and another brooklyn as a life long new yorker i vote for the lower east side and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos they lived in an insulated isolated little enclave some interaction with non latinos might have created some excitement interest or tension remember west side story and now for the oft criticized cinematography i don t know if it was my tv or what but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me the apt the furniture and the faces were all orange what was that supposed to mean and the apt did look pretty cramped to me somebody here mentioned that the old apt s tenements had very big rooms well maybe years ago what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into or very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them and another annoying thing this is the second family movie i ve seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off is this private sex act necessary for us to watch please spare me what s up with these directors so victor vargas is a pleasant little movie it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents which they did but the writers let them down giving them a flat unspectacular script to work with enjoy the show but keep your fingers near the fast forward button 
this movie was the worst movie i have seen since date movie i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie so i don t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it 
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don t send an assassin it s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it s good it s so bad i d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it s that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i m sorry i don t get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung s cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance monkeys clerks etc there s no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i ve said enough here 
i saw the p m showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i don t actually pay for movies anymore i didn t really find any redeeming qualities there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but let s be honest it s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasn t going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months 
this movie deserves more than a but i m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a resulting in it getting a rating that ll take it into the top list seriously it s not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it s ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say i m rick james b tch no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear i m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad movie wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
when discussing a movie titled snakes on a plane we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they slither these snakes do nothing of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole less is more ethic or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them sparingly take one look at john carpenters the thing here we have real slime and gore of eerie proportions years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap snakes on a plane when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwards sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure i m with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no i d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie the current generation seem to have very low expectations and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including doa dead or alive another cgi animal film called flushed away and another crap looking comedy named click in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap british horror comedy i ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for in months time and if you re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips forget it 
 pyramid clues deep blue sea tremors slither eight legged freaks pyramid category movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane hell with that definition i d have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills the sad truth is that this isn t even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies anaconda besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo cube o wilson stoltz wuhrer in the same flick you had jon voight pulling off the all time cinematic heist his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a so ludicrous it s fun movie in the end snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for according to jim 
i d give this a negative rating if i could i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson oh how original if i were a year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie became so popular seriously the worst thing i ve ever seen i wasn t entertained it wasn t funny i wasn t even bored i wasn t anything it wasn t even so bad it was good it s just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don t even rent this movie no clue how it s getting such a high rating 
what can i say i m a secret fan of over the top action and horror films especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo but i m not a fan of snake on a plane there are three potential draws to this film the comedy of the situation the horror and the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane firstly this film isn t written as a tongue in cheek horror or a comedy and there are only or points in the film where you ll smile to yourself if you want to get the feel of the film the trailer genuinely represents the movie a horror secondly if you re expecting a film full of action and shocks you won t be disappointed it doesn t stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attention thirdly although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn t wear off but you ll leave the cinema thinking what was all the fuss about i know this movie has a high rating but it doesn t add up a many of the reviews where written before the film was released and b the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal of people rating the movie with only of people giving it why such an enormous gap 
i went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band wilco instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt one sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer songwriter a gut wrenching confession by the fallen member s friend for like years saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get offers from other labels oh the tension not they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn t exist this doesn t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch from the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don t have and think they re some kind of guardians for the art of music which they most definitely are not and i thought the music sucked and i couldn t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer i give it a 
disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and direction all in all very obviously an ill conceived first effort at commercial film making by the good people at tbn tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora lam to the big screen but the omega code is an unfortunate miscue as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their ministry but this isn t an example of it don t waste your money go rent china cry instead 
raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real unfortunately there is no reality to this film the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake the reason bad directing peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal it seems mr sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel wrong it just gives it a badly made feel similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what s on screen instead of enhance it of course what s on screen is so painfully fake as if mr sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he is overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr sollett is next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes 
the idea had potential but the movie was poorly scripted poorly acted poorly shot and poorly edited there are lots of production flaws for example dr lane s daughter who never ages despite the passing years wait for video but don t expect much 
interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the three part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the s dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist s son you too can play high roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money 
what was this about pre destination you can not change the future cause it has already been written i ll give it this much i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie this movie took a concept and made it watchable if you re looking for a recommendation see it at matinee prices no thrills but an interesting concept they should have left the y k reference out 
this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated casper s character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug it s pretty much an insult to the audience s ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didn t make use of it i didn t feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinion and that s all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good 
this movie is not based on the bible it completely leaves christ out of the movie they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ let alone talk about it it does not quote from scriptures the end times are called the great tribulation the movie does not even show bad times the seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a second news cast of the sea changing it s structure the anti christ was killed years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended the only part they got correct was there was two prophets the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i wanted to take unsaved people to it i feel that the movie is evil it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books the second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development i have seen better episodes of miami vice 
i truly wish i was not writing this review i m a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so i m sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes i m sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special i m not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i could ve gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but i m not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didn t have either i m sorry but i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone and that s the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere 
the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane s family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn s family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn t do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i ve already went on about lane s family now that i m over the acting i ll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn t just secede they d send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we re not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short 
if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become this one would take the prize the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be the acting was bad at best casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film michael york s work was a fair match for the role since he was the center of the film and did a good job this plot was sickening and very disturbing no tender or immature minds should see this film this is how a basic good vs evil plot can go astray there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles who look for ways to market this type of junk there must have been something censored out to get a pg rating but it was still awful 
i didn t know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn t i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film 
yes i admit i cried during this movie it was so incredibly disappointing that i couldn t help myself but cry tbn trinity broadcasting network has done it again first with having the million dollar man ex professional wrestler on their program and now this the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies it was quite amusing yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate the movie follows what is known as the bible code rather than following actual biblical scripture this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie i highly recommend you do not watch this movie even if your life depended on it 
 this movie basks too much in its own innocence it doesn t tell a story it s more a big time snooze fest while the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller 
what else is left to say i ve read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes please anway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codes for those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started 
quite honestly the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time during the first minutes i sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if i should demand a refund but since i hadn t paid to see it in the first place passes i figured i might as well stay and i didn t think it could possibly get any worse it did i will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane a motivational speaker with two phds the characterization was inconsistent for example lane despite his credentials is a complete nitwit then there s the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code also terrible action sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence that s cute for grammar school writing assignments but it s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture the pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every seconds later the pacing improves but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around and as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even lane s young daughter ages that was disconcerting there are a few good things though the quality of the film e g lack of graininess is high and very attractive the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god finally to help him this proved to be quite exhilarating even to me someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie unfortunately it was followed by major incomprehensibility the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done michael ironside had nothing to do and michael york was just weird i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better in a nutshell the omega code disappoints definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars 
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time 
i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about people we all expected a good piece of christian film making what we got was an excruciatingly painful drawn out and pretty boring attempt at a film it has good looking production values but also has poor acting a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction from the first minutes we all knew it would be a long night we all hated it and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than anaconda none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than hours flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can t save this bad bad movie i d give it a out of and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable movie werewolf the night before i saw this movie 
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the year s best 
i am a youth pastor s wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didn t get it and i didn t enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door 
i m a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind 
 i would highly recommend seeing this movie after viewing it you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying at least it wasn t the omega code forget my money i want my time back 
i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry the first minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming boring and not funny at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable i didn t like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed i don t recommend this movie 
i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons for the first half hour it s actually pretty decent although the acting isn t any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesn t seem half bad in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao another recent dominican film which turned out to be much much better than i expected the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic unfortunately i don t think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they f ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them about minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age cgi effects dating to what i m guessing would be the s but the whole plot just goes down the drain the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners to top it all off and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert it all turns out to be a dream oh my who didn t see that coming oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie well after about an hour into it i start thinking hmmmm something just doesn t seem right about the sound track but what can it be and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art perhaps a comedy to match france s amelie or an action flick to match thailand s ong bak an animation as akira was to japan a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england or a socio awakening journey as waking life had here in the states i would give it a but i ve seen much worse come out of dr search los jodedores and you ll know what i m talking about 
someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some people i didn t see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced self conscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirty sadly it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way it s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as art it s little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such raves i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspired a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are you ll get yet another by the numbers let s shake the camera around for two hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them 
it has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone and yet the producers roberto angel salcedo calls him an actor but i don t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting period the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didn t and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i don t buy it but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvd s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work out maka
the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay in a positive note kim bassinger s and pat morita s performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid jason vanness
one of the worst films i have ever seen how to define worst i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again somehow one hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans mary kay saleswomen las vegas gays fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one is beyond me the worst part of this mess and that takes some work is the mangled script in elvis words and songs that he would speak perform in the s are quoted worst special effect that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis grave potentially the most photographed recognizable grave in the world resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere potentially this film s biggest audience would be elvis fans however the rampant stupidity nixon gave elvis a dea badge not fbi credentials and i could go on and on actually undercuts that conventional wisdom ugh i used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie this is truly a horrible horrible film 
i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot had potential who wouldn t love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he s going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an elvis constellation which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators sending them crashing through the roof bad really bad which is the theme for the whole movie i d avoid this one at all costs 
being an elvis fan i can t understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in and these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike starr is funny specially as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis sucks overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you bubba ho tep instead of this mess 
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman with odd ties to elvis presley running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a still attractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay by mitchell ganem and adam michael garber hasn t an iota of good humor the stereotypes and low ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a shambling shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hands always in the same position and a non plussed look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from 
my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie impressive cast even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really i have to admit though tom hank s cameo almost made it worth it what was that about tom did you lose a bet the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though by far a classic the premise is good basinger s character struggling with existence as a pink lady is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales this happens as corbett s character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex wife motivated by what else extortion as they both make their way they have numerous run ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas soon the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer unfortunately premise doesn t mean the movie was good when watching this movie imagine you are back in the first grade when story lines and continuity aren t really important it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn t really make sense the movie tries hard but ultimately falls way way way short ultimately it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny it isn t the worst but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don t say i didn t warn you 
omg the only reason i m giving this movie a instead of a is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis in the box apart from that how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time there are no laughs to mention the stereotypes are pathetic the cast is wasted the direction is amateurish now that i think about it most of the blame probably lies with the director joel zwick he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved don t waste your time like i did but then i enjoy a good train wreck geez now the system is telling me i need more lines here ya go this movie should be called return to sender okay now that was funnier than anything in the movie 
elvis has left the building and he s lucky because he didn t have to watch this unfunny stinker scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing filled with unfunny deaths trite gay characteratures and hack jokes this film is more desperate than amusing this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement let us remember her the way she was talented and not what she s become david leisure the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen she really looks like her and is actually pretty good the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo the cameo isn t all that funny but at least its not painful one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie 
i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy 
raising victor vargas a review you know raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of oatmeal it s warm and gooey but you re not sure if it feels right try as i might no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn t quite feel right victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director s part apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof he was right but it didn t fool me raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen year old boy called you guessed it victor vargas victor rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they ve toured the movie starts off in `ugly fat donna s bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best friend harold kevin rivera comes a looking for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor vargas runs off for damage control yet even with the embarrassing implication that he s been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor s eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy judy marte who s not just pretty but a strong and independent too the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film the story also focuses on victor s family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino also played by real life brother to victor silvestre rasuk and his sister vicky krystal rodriguez the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp daddy his feelings for judy and his grandmother s conservative catholic upbringing the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few but glaring errors throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky nino grandma judy and even judy s best friend melonie the problem is we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood we know that he knows how to lick his lips and comb his fro and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack but that s all we know that nino plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano we know his sister nicki is a gossip loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv we know that grandma is a hard working traditional latina woman who s trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption yet where is the titular character victor vargas he s in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us this is by far the film s biggest flaw victor vargas isn t so much a character but a ping pong ball bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother but we never get to know who victor vargas really is this is important because as i ve mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he s a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan he s a total alpha male victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all why should anyone so by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways how could such a two dimensional character have any depth if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand held shot raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner city neighborhood to the big screen something that few films have done before in the past the film has been complimented for feeling so real and i won t argue with that i haven t seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writer director peter sollett was way too dependent on close ups and hand held shots this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep breathing exercises to keep from passing out as the film continues the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell victor vargas s cheap cologne the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast the indoor scenes of inner city apartments make them look small and cramp which is not true i ve been in those type apartments i used to live in one they re not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they re decent living spaces by the movie s standards you d think that these apartments were x cells of brick and mortar chipped paint and cracked walls unfortunately sollett s constant use of close ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom in on one scene come off as totally amateurish but raising victor vargas is only sollett s second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films one review i read summarized the movie as `ethnicity for ethnicity s sake and i cannot agree more if victor vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters applicability wouldn t matter whether they were latino chinese etc yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle class suburbia with a bunch of teeny bopper white kids the results wouldn t be such glowing reviews and we d see the film s flaws more clearly indeed some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question for example victor nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe any self respecting latino family wouldn t have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen year old girl at first i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified considering how conservative the grandmother is you d think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full time i could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie unfortunately my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film maybe it s because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen maybe it s because without any further introspection by the film victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot blooded latino who ll just end up shouting to girls from his car `hey bay bee ju want to get into my luv mah cheen either way i don t like him so ultimately how can i like a film about him so if you ll excuse me i m going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits 
i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn t seen the far superior bbc adaptation of this classic novel the major problem i had with this version was the casting of anthony way as tom long anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time tom s midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would befriend the far younger hatty in the bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable for a movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the tv effects the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the bbc version fetches well over second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under need i say more 
if you like bad movies this is the one to see it s incredibly low budget special effects you ll see what i mean and use of non actors was what gave this film it s charm if you re bored with a group of friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem it s mulletrific 
i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steve s animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script don t go if you must see it wait for the video 
a difficult film to categorize i was never giving it concentration consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn t say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters what their roles were nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted out this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which i ve better things to do too than be on here a high 
on steve irwin s show he s hillarious he doesn t even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn t even what i would call a movie i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he s just saying oh this is one nasty bloke and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn t you expect him to be dead and terri had the worst acting i d ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says steve she didn t sound scared or anything it was just steve i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid 
i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldn t have the nerve to go even feet away from a croc but everything in this movie is bad farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time it s a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is years old i m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this 
gday mates just watched croc hunter the movie it was alright but the show seems more real this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters a few things steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles yeeeowch for reals you know that hurts and cant they jump up high hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff there was two major cleavage shots in this movie when terry find that baby joey she goes like we have to nurture them just like a baby woah i thought she was gonna up breast feed that kid that woulda made it pg though while on terry did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry s knowledge on ritual mating she knows her sex stuffs movie takes place in queensland austrailia i want a koala dingo and joey steve s dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite wielding hottie oh and if anyone else watches this try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc he was eating her sheep i would be mad too 
so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films it s too noisy well steve is too noisy he s just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blas teenager i can hear it now that movie was so stupid or the tylenol with codeine i d say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasn t happened yet i agreed they re beauties but i m still not going to pet them plot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore but the movie was filled with animals and steve and terri which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that way i was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and terri having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still can t believe we won t see steve anymore i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel at least i can t imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is crikey 
i caught this at a test screening all i can say is what the hell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it s bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isn t even funny the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop them that s about all the story there is the rest is over the top lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that s right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film 
ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans now this movie wasn t a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seeker specialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost non existent casting was horrible the acting wasn t even worth elementary school level actors the direction must be faulted as well if you can t get a half way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for for me for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldn t want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie 
this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the noise and yet that s all it has some sense of a broadway without the bang the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded it s a musical disappointing sinatra intolerable sinatra s fianc surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice delight brando s understated singing very biased surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes it s the bone structure how i would ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again 
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars belief to be fair some of sykes creative camera work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain t a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash i give the zombie chronicles but generously raise my rating to since i didn t get to view the film with the benefit of d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn t have made that much of a difference 
i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwin s death from a stingray attack in it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in but i didn t hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently it s supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isn t very funny at all a u s satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of what s inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terri s mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i don t think i found anything even mildly amusing it s also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be she s not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major clich in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn t help steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side you re on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie i m sure it does help if you re a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there s no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly haven t been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it won t help like i said there s no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes 
some people say steve irwin s larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act watch this film it s obvious he can t act steve irwin dangerman star of the small screen in his crocodile hunter diaries croc files and eponymous crocodile hunter series you see a naming trend here or is it just me rockets his larger than strife persona to the big screen with crocodile hunter collision course yup there s a definite trend of words beginning with c basically an episode of crocodile hunter mashed together with a b movie on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer magda szubanski steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies lachy hulme and kenneth ransom out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed will it hurt my credibility to say they re on a collision course with wackiness what credibility ed note the plot is irrelevant as it is steve s animal magnetism that propels the film if you find his persona trying the film is a failure but if you re a fan of either him as a businessman conservationist or just plain ass klown or his television shows expect more of the same on a wide screen budget john stainton faithful liege best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter oeuvre can it be called that with a straight face writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks and terri steve s spouse of years fiercest ally and closest friend treat it like it is one of their documentaries breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera whilst all the other characters behave as if they re in a bad movie well it wouldn t be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve s life we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn t at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics or run screaming into the bush anything but continue filming casually with great lighting crisp audio and seven action angles while terri is unfairly painted as steve s mildly incompetent sidekick her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear shaped buttock hugging jeans for the last i m not complaining steve goes about his business as usual of show and tell with creatures intent on killing him doing all his stunts himself because well to him they re not really stunts just a day at the office of course watching this madman s koo koo adventures after his tragic death in september casts a strange detachment over the proceedings but to those of us who never met him this kind of malarkey as well as various incarnations of the crocodile hunter series in constant re runs keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints so enjoy this diversion for what it is a half baked movie featuring a full on legend he died doing what he loved interacting with wildlife and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that movie maniacs visit poffysmoviemania com 
the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines don t feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times it may sound weak and clich but it s true you re way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin it s more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is i m sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn t give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply isn t funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren t good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene s feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly wouldn t recommend this movie watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential 
i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won t say who that s kept under wraps but i must admit it wasn t as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but it s a shame he wasn t in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn t that entertaining well i m glad my sister paid for renting dvd s from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea out of 
i couldn t watch more than minutes of it it s a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windows annoying what else it s so badly framed all the time it s just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but i m pretty sure i d be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it s gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost it ll save you the bucks or so for the rental and that h hour of your life you ll never get back 
if you liked blair with you ll like this one it has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack and it has the same non existent plot and suspenseful moments it also has tom savini so if you like romero s dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez from dusk till dawn you re in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as well no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i ve seen in a long time and i ve seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of time the only reason why i gave this movie instead of was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp looking plastic teeth no i m just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote form stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover 
when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clich s that you can guarantee will follow the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst the van will break down whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly only a girl will be left alive from the group there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clich s and openly he wonders if people will get it i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clich s within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn t like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert s swears blind in voice over i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don t know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn t amazing its sh t he isn t wrong 
ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b movies since we do them ourselves anyway the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff and tom savini there is just no way this movie can fail right wrong it just seems like such a waste there was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there x the characters were well they really lacked any kind of personality the effects were terrible and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something anything to happen but no oh here comes the nymphs great oh they re kissing again and now for the violence ok nothing really happens again oh now they run around and the closeups of eyes again oh heres tom savini oh he died right ok maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh cool a severed head the end oh crap and finally since i m so full of myself i ll tell you this give me a van six actors a weird looking house tom savini a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you ve ever seen i ve made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects better acting and a better script than this what is this johannes guy doing making cool movies is easy it could have been so great i m really upset 
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie i d write more but i m still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend renting it bobbins and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces p s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
booted out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic fangs have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by it s not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction i have seen in a long time director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled shock moments but for the most part the film is technically amateurish throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson and you have one real bad movie on your hands some fun may be derived from the film s sheer shoddiness and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour but most will find this a chore to sit through 
nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc but the heat is on and he can t find a secure location he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can t make a prim missionary sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don t my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from albinoni to zz top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren t my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank loesser mankiewicz jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak blaine s two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don t advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you re rockin the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie s trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show 
oh god where to begin bad acting characters you just don t care about are they american or british they seem to think they are in america because where else is this enormous forest in the midlands one big fault they are driving all night through these woods unless they are going around and around they d have been in scotland come the morning when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over and they re mobiles don t work so what do they do split up of course make it easier to be picked off so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to care for the unconscious woman so what do they do rather than make her comfortable cushion her head cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire yrds away and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were ejected from heaven to live amongst us so what do they do embark on sexual relations with any men they encounter no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off i think they are missing the point these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are cannabalistic vampires and as for tom savini saying how breath takingly beautiful they are well those gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face dept the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible sirens rubbish film waste of from my local library 
note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted minutes of your life on a movie that s so worthless it s insulting i watched this because the premise sounded slightly promising it s not it s just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren t good either the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it s not it s so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he s the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting come to think of it savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie it s not that he s bad but he s almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from dusk till dawn and he s been milking that at horror conventions ever since but let s focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie everything else is a negative obviously the writer is allergic to originality the script is terrible that s all a given after the first minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it s written and directed by the same person expect garbage 
i rented this flick for one reason tom savini i respect his work but this was a real let down i had horrible clich s half of the film was naked women so called fallen angels running around trying to act scary oh and then there was the occasional blair witch black and white motion sicken camera scenes tom s character was really awful horrible script and you got to love these lines they use is anyone there who is out there this isn t funny no but your acting was i wish i could give this flick a oh the names of the characters judd molly ally emilio but they did leave out anthony the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting 
this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them he doesn t really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didn t say how he managed to escape either not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident 
the plot was very thin although the idea of naked sexy man eating sirens is a good one the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie splatter lesbian mouth licking shots in between the characters were wooden and one dimensional the ending made no sense considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush naturally and of course the lesbian moments i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the shower scene the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely if i had been watching this alone and aged i would have really enjoyed it for about minutes with hand of the remote control then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza 
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no plot even then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic 
forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister emilio richard cambridge ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine anyway before they know it they re deep in a forest emilio clumsily runs over a woman frances da costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they re travelling in won t start they can t get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woods this english production was written directed by johannes roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it other s not personally it didn t do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then there s stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the character s are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that s going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes here director johannes doesn t do anything special it s not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at there s a few decent horror scenes the tom savini character is great whenever he s on screen although why didn t he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly it s a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in there s a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps much technically forest of the damned is ok it s reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye catching this was shot in england wales it s quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than acting forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe i m missing something but it s not a film i have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments there s not much here to recommend 
from the start this film was awful why was it that bad if it isn t the naked women not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening then it s the crazy old guy at the gas station who isn t so much crazy but more i m not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis apparently without touching you and this is according to the opening scene they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up then you have sophie holland who plays ally i have never seen such baaaaaad acting she is more of a me me me if i m not having fun no one else is and i don t wanna do this so i won t and i m the meanest cow on the planet i m sarcastic petty and if i don t get things my way i will sulk kind of person reminds me more of a yr old girl s attitude i don t think it s even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch or how low budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the locked door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side this film is completely laughable if it were a spoof then it would have been successful only just though but as a horror film is was just plain wrong i can t even being to describe everything that went t ts up in this movie i would run out of room although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini s character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow so is it any wonder they don t get away with it and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened no pain no weakening from blood loss nothing but the silliest part is when all of a sudden and i mean that literally it s one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs and then lo and behold shaun hutson picks her up of course not without a line to promote his books altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors but suddenly and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why she s evil herself and lures hutson to his death then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can even after his dazzling performance on why no one should ever venture there for whatever reason cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere and here endeth the film finally my conclusion if you hadn t already guessed by now absolute rubbish there was no proper thought went into it at all whoever was aiming the camera needed firing and come to think of it so did of the cast if the right director actors and budget got behind this it could have been decent but once again low budget english horror films but the rest of the genre the country and the english film making industry to shame and i m english so i m allowed to say that in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area all i kept thinking throughout this was jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this its absolute cow s testicles but i can t turn a film off after i ve started watching it unfortunately i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well if there was an option for then believe me i woulda chose that cuz this film isn t even worth the one point i did give it but this is just my opinion watch it and decide for yourself 
oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless nudity this isn t entertainment this is hell hell don t waste your money time or life on this pit of evil it s just god damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it i d rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this this sinful act again please take my advice and stay the f k away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldn t even have to call this thing a film just stay away 
i ve seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie but this movie was beyond terrible the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying usually when i watch scary movies i think it s dumb when the characters hears a noise in house forest school etc and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least they re believable when they do it this movie couldn t even get that right this is a movie that ll make other b horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who s thinking of watching this movie will think again it s awful 
though frank loesser s songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they re bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz lethargic staging and uninspired presentation when it s over it barely feels like you ve watched a musical mankiewicz doesn t seem to know how to present loesser s challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping `adelaide s lament concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye s faux spiritual `sit down you re rockin the boat has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows stage book has none of the wit that his films like `all about eve have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he s in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets 
angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens talk about high concept on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen time his five minute presence seems a tad long the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day mediocre acting and amateurish gore effects don t help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton s most famous movie so bad that it is really bad 
this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american 
this film actually works from a fairly original idea i ve never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway however the way that it executes this idea isn t original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks nutcases zombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme many films of this ilk don t have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they re beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any back story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the horror trash category it s been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting this is one of the film s major assets as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn t ever seem to have much up its sleeve the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clich d in the extreme doesn t help as you re more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away the cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesn t get to have fun in the special effects department the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves the naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasn t for them this film would get very boring very quickly there s nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks you might find some enjoyment here 
for the first forty minutes empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didn t know why i thought it was good but now i do one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful i don t mind films with psychos and things to prove a point take jackie brown for example but they re all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad he doesn t seem tight enough to be a drug dealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs out of out of 
i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre it was actually sold out i actually went to see solaris instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in victor rosa john leguizamo a tough streetwise street pharmacist freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack peter sarsgaard things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish denise richards this happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist but they did so it s not in fact there s not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview if you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps go to the website download the preview save yourself there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack is i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired twice most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets and i may shatter the fabric of the space time continuum with a concept as mind numbing as this they both had less talent and musical ability the acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and denise richards is at best styrofoam and ziploc bag you know things are bad when john leguizamo he was in the pest upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities 
the plot was predictable and fighting with guns gets old but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don t really care about real movies i would endulge in true art movies like clerks something about mary el mariachi or la taqueria 
tedious girls at reform school flick which plays somewhat like a prison movie chris linda blair is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father once in the de facto jail she is gang raped by her fellow female inmates overlong even at minutes with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene out of 
i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop s and this one surely is an oop one year after the exorcist she s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star that s one of the reason s many of her films are oop she gives a good performance in this movie it s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn t have any friends played at an age of playing a girl of that s funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity in most editions it s cut out why i don t know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no t a so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesn t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep it s just about that year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me if you re a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is 
i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer a customer of metasonix modular synths made by someone dear to me the jacket art says the version i give it one point for a strong female one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster s light blue eyes of which there are plenty of shots of it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming the pool has a plexiglass viewing window while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece the sets were marginally impressive that is rich people s houses in l a and mendanassos sp where the castle was i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around the wind wasn t fierce enough to be believable to me i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty etc and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire blow out the match then throw the match into the fire dumb stuff like that it was clunky at best oh well robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it 
 st watched out of dir walter lang disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this much heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the king of siam by yul brynner but the movie doesn t really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don t fully understand the character s and their situations i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didn t stand out a lot for me the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil there is a side forbidden romance between the king s newest wife played by rita moreno a latino as an arab come on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though deborah kerr as the main female character annie is ok but not that convincing either the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really 
 this review may have spoilers but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather is never transformed into a swan all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery the writing made me very nervous too the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory why would any girl want to marry a boorish self absorbed prince who disliked women turner s turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply s what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography matte work and production design it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes sets and settings as the story unfolded for some cinderella storytelling go for two gems rodgers and hammerstein s cinderella musical with lesley ann warren even with the obvious stagey tv s look to the sets this is the best version on celluloid bar none an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment engaging diverting and memorable writing and music this is the classic ever after this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well 
disappointing musical version of margaret landon s anna and the king of siam itself filmed in with irene dunne and rex harrison has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in to accept job as tutor to the king s many children and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process stagy picture begins well but quickly loses energy and focus yul brynner reprising his stage triumph as the king is a commanding presence but is used per the concocted story as a buffoon kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better despite having to lip synch to marni nixon s vocals perhaps having already played this part to death brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast second half with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of uncle tom s cabin is quite ridiculous and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering brynner won a best actor oscar but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water overlong heavy and old fashioned in the worst sense of the term from 
this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the s musicals or you don t if you do you ll love this personally i prefer the s and most of the s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and eleanor powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off this film is a case in point the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didn t have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i don t think i ve seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the goody two shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam i which she had however divorcing myself from likes and dislikes there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the r h musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of big production musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn t able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady yul brynner is king mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isn t progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna leonowens will set him straight secular progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more bark than bite character justifiably he is the big star of this film brynner had magnetism even in the magnificent seven yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience in summary it s a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it i ll leave it at that 
madison is not too bad if you like simplistic non offensive family friendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson muncey cantrell slovak etc prepare to be disappointed professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clich in the book i needn t repeat what they ve said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind numbing roar of six allison or rolls merlin aircraft engines wound up to rpm s never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you you didn t hear it you felt it real hydro buffs know exactly what i m talking about there s none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical score and then there are the close up shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home town hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky salute from a bridge pier in reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock hard water at speeds above mph as one reviewer so aptly put it the sport deserves better than this finally since another user brought up anachronisms i ll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field neither existed in 
this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with but first the movie it s a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn t have the flair of the original film version with william holden what they couldn t afford to hire more than twelve people as extras why move the movie up to so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests why not and give her a line about the civil rights movement as for the casting some hits some misses jay o sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes he s believable as an ex bmoc jock but he doesn t have the raw sensuality of william holden i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played she didn t project the innocence or ignorance that the character required maybe it s because she and brolin were about years older than the characters should be but then again holden was ten years too old bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can t seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from the taming of the shrew as for mr inge s play i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue the twilight zone i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode spur of the moment where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter 
perhaps it s because i am so in love with the william holden kim novak version or because i m not a gen x er but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen without the original s soundtrack it just seemed like another typical tv movie yes about as bland as kraft cheese

william cooke and paul talbot share director writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth and a scroungy town tramp named ralph gunnar hansen of leatherface fame wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire one tale is the old retread of the hook two teens on lover s lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s t as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas who can t wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies without a big budget for special effects campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse a bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale the acting is understandably not award worthy cast members include tres holton courtney ballard h ray york johnny tamblyn walter kaufmann kevin draine david avin and paul kaufmann 
well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the money lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox diana rigg 
the first power was a terrible film that came out during the late s early s era of cheaply made horror films i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain t even funny the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role he plays a hard boiled cop and tracey griffith melanie s more attractive sister plays a psychic don t waste your time with this one because it s bad what a minute i take it back this movie makes a great party film check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun she has the nicest legs i ve ever seen on a nun that wasn t in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick yeow this marked an end of an era for l d p his star was tarnished and he couldn t draw flies to a dung heap it was d t v for him until his ressurection a few years later not recommended unless you re desperate 
people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer whose name escapes me at the moment whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never ending murder spree it s not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on by the way other low budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise like house shocker and ghost in the machine anyway the first power a k a pentagram isn t a completely terrible effort but the script overly reverts to clich s and lacks genuine thrills the film starts off as an okay albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe thanks to tess helpful hints detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing the first power gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world that s what i would do in his position channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper he annoyingly calls him buddy boy all the time and possesses the bodies of logan s friends and colleagues in order to trick him even though never really boring or poorly realized it s a very weak film to endure mostly because you constantly get the feeling of d j vu writer director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clich the killer got sexually abused as a child and even the players lines can easily be predicted as soon as griffith explains she s able to predict the future you just know that somewhere at some point in the film she s going to say the ridiculously overused line i tell people who to live their lives but my own life is a mess yawn lou diamond philips performance is adequate enough but it s rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of la bamba and stand and deliver serious as a tough copper there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson forrest gump carmen argenziano when a stranger calls and b movie horror legend david gale re animator appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film 
bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance visually stunning in some parts but that s about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full minutes of drivel if you re really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper 
patrick channing jeff kober is a disciple of satan serial killer who possesses the first power even after being captured by detective russell logan lou diamond phillips and executed in the gas chamber he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton tracy griffith melanie g s half sister he attempts to stop channing this concept probably had some possibilities i think but ultimately the first power suffers from routine scripting and film making this is nothing we haven t seen before sometimes done better there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers more to the point it s not very thrilling and it certainly isn t scary phillips is a hard sell as a tough as nails cynical cop stereotype and griffith doesn t seem to be trying very hard best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober doing his best to be supremely creepy the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind therefore 
i jotted down a few notes here on the first power lou lambada diamond phillips satanic serial killer yuppie hell fest lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in designer overcoats a designer silk suit and seeing his month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed and amazing breasts that are hi lighted in the nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan at least back in the s our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination by the final minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like professional psychics living in los angeles can afford million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch s mullholland dr which at least had the good sense to make it s condo resident a successful movie director the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his how s it going buddy boy line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since thanks for the ride lady from creepshow underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released movie satanists always amaze me here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people s apartments speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible can fly and is able to put his being inside of other people s bodies and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film s conclusion yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins and on and on to be watched in the company of wise cracking friends while consuming beer you ll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously 
detective russell logan lou diamond phillips has a major problem on his hands the serial killer patrick channing jeff kober for whom psychic extraordinaire tess tracy griffith helped him capture has been resurrected with the first power given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber and can possess the bodies of the weak somehow russell who joins forces with tess who has an understanding of what they are up against will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands they will seek help from sister marguerite elizabeth arlen who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop channing a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of channing ridding the world of his evil she ll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell who ll need all the help he can get when channing kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual ceremony in the film mykelti williamson always a reliable welcome supporting actor gets the partner of russell role so you know what will happen to him as in films of this type everyone around russell is dying but when he attempts to kill channing he s merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses pure occult rubbish stupid from the gate to the finish line phillips and griffith try i ll give them that but in a flick like this they don t stand a chance kober who is normally often always effective as the heavy is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips 
the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he s done so well in the last years kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fifties but it s not enough the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers kober is his latest catch but kober s in league with a lower power and they re going to team up and make lou s life miserable for him even after kober is given the gas chamber his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises mykelti williamson is on hand as lou s partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou will he succeed in battling forces from beyond by the time the film ends you no longer care lou really got trapped in a turkey maybe the devil made him do this film 
when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it s touch and go whether you should revisit it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober the first power is not a very good movie sad to say it s chock full of those cop clich s and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the over confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case ahhh this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a s demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say he s not convincing at all but he tries his best and i ve never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day s work and a brain switch off is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i ll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy 
an annoying experience improvised dialogue handheld cameras for no effect directionless plot contrived romance ick to the whole mess ron silver was the only real actor gretta sacchi was terrible henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more 
 i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally self important i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it i dont recommend it period 
i don t remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going i realize that hollywood s greatest pastime is navel gazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with for what it s worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics i disagree 
awful awful awful no i didn t like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didn t need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose i m at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday i m not a movie maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of two shots in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plot line and they were to improvise the dialogue henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn t flow along the line of the conversation and i m not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silver s remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break his her concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the ^ documents times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia ron silver anouk ami and maximilian schell suggests it was a slow news week for them peter bogdanovich had a what the hell am i doing here look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look i m a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the hand held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude as i suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot that at least approached cinema verite so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing odd minutes i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided there was really nothing avant garde about it it didn t come across as a work of art and yet it wasn t a documentary either i know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced cannes correctly so i gave it 
movie industry is tricky business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too that s the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an insightful film about film and indeed no better proof of the industry s trickiness than seeing anouk aim e and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self do the latter please or our relationship is not only professional it s private as well it s a rather complex situation to handle isn t it yes it is my dear between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel lobbies and american movie posters no sign of non american film presence on the croisette recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable making the minutes of the film feel like ages jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame 
rural family drama with perhaps a nod to ordinary people concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap despite downbeat subject matter given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring unfortunately the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience what with robert duvall glenn close and wilford brimley in the cast the movie is nearly a small scaled reunion of the natural too bad this project didn t get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping memorable picture from 
after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of stella street i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn t be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren t funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 
apparently the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood i use the word apparently because without listening to a director andy copp s commentary which i didn t have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers won t have a clue what it is about gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage but unless they re also fond of pretentious headache inducing experimental art house cinema they ll find this one a real chore to sit through minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one s sanity if you ve still got all your marbles you ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watched the whole thing but am well aware that i m completely barking 
this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh t if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty 
i bought this movie for euro not knowing what it was all about i thought hmmm a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore it wasn t funny alright it was disturbing very disturbing and i don t mind disturbing movies but this one just didn t mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing to do hmmm the quality of the images were terrible the acting there was no acting just some fcked up fcker mutilating himself for over minutes this is probably material for sicko s jurking off on extreme gore don t watch this it s not worth your time its just awful i wish i never bought this they should mutilate the guy who made this
an avent garde nightmarish extremely low budget film that has delusions of grandeur hard to sit through i get the message that child abuse is wrong wow big revelation i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this yes that s sarcasm don t watch this film if you re offended by nudity of either the male or female gender don t watch it if you re the least bit squeamish don t watch it if you care about acting on second thought just don t watch it period my grade d dvd extras making the movie the premiere interview with kristie bowersock deleted scenes movie stills director s commentary versions of the teaser trailer music video by the azoic a classroom video experiment
first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero budget flick is none of it the picture quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever heard and as for the fx well the super low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isn t no concept a wafer thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog i think i counted about sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about times same for a lot of film sequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of self mutilation so far so good but for these pseudo art idiot directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense freshly taken out bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth hole why and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie disturbing yes sick yes necessary no artistically no everyone mistaking this cheap gore show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd s the wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way i hope this was your first and last movie andrew cobb and all you gore heads out there remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically art 
this is a good example of how not to make a film there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director s commentary this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors the climax is anti climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if you re not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it the director s commentary was a one shot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isn t necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie the movie was shot many years ago on mm and super film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse 
it s a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches it s an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop motion animation it s weird but it s not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect it s the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrove hall did far more attractive things with stop motion interestingly this is a french production as such it re enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary 
i don t know why this has the fans it does and i don t know why i have even given it the score i have this is preposterous there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen but this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by italian standards not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant phoned in performances i reckon he turned up did a day s work and cleared off leaving mr d amato to get others to fill in ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle maybe i just wasn t in the right mood 
 i don t understand none of this makes any sense exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie i know exactly how he feels the story by the film s director aristide massacessi good old joe d amato using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murder mystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy s garbage such as jess franco s more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain conscious opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by ewa aulin who stars in the equally strange death laid an egg is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbr ck after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home where she is tended to by creepy dr sturges klaus kinski in a throwaway role the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr and mrs ravensbr ck meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin so far so good i thought to myself at this point we ve had hunchbacks incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female nudity all ingredients of a great trashy euro horror what follows however is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from edgar allan poe s the black cat to tell a very silly utterly bewildering and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb but given the choice i would much rather watch one of the director s sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible meandering surreal s gothic horror just ain t my thing out of purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness rounded up to for imdb 
 spoiler warning first of all i rated this movie out of the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew s strange traps her friends are unbelievably nasty the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers 
a lot of other reviewers here including many whose opinions i respect hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard personally i didn t like it at all its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well unfortunately the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d amato does not d amato s most well known films are infamous for their high gross out quotient this an early film by him doesn t have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious anthropophagous and beyond the darkness did ultimately its an incoherent film that doesn t manage to involve the viewer in any way without the sleaze factor either it becomes very boring as i said others have enjoyed this film but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing there are a few pluses for the film ewa aulin from candy is in it and she looks pretty hot and is often naked however cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film he seems bored with the role and doesn t have the manic intensity he does at his finest the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore still this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring 
i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard in these days of single mothers that may seem very far fetched but it was very true and i m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didn t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing i m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to get married and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i don t like it s a wonderful life either 
this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the on screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film s last five minutes a briefly glimpsed port a potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film s chief villain no prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman s studio when he d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera but without the discipline corman would impose 
time spent watching this film was time wasted i do not dislike science fiction i do not reject any genre per se since good work can be done in any genre this film however is not good work i cannot fault the visuals when not involving alien makeups and the special effects are impressive the story was not out and out bad for a trekkish comic book but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers interest attention money went the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture the acting was mostly very bad indeed there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad sad scared whatever okay so it was a sf series pilot since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium i m astonished the pilot sold the series or is the money also in the hands of technerds 
the real shame of the gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the despicably shallow plot the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction takashima i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova even for just five minutes she has that sarcasm that wit that double edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable sadly though the babylon pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination patricia tallman who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome telepath i shall leave you with one final thought why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer space frog man even though she is a woman thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show 
you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still sub par dont get me wrong b the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series i dont like o hare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of babylon squared and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a b fan and havent seen this movie see it if you arent a b fan dont you wont want to watch the series 
while i count myself as a fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series 
i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a for consistency the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that information it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors weren t bad but the plot needs more innovation 
wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake it s the worst movie i ve seen in the past decade no exaggeration as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an year old child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that can t fully explain the atrocious production values of this clich ridden piece of trash i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the character s name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirror image n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chock full of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clich s neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre pubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all it s a total waste of time i d strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it s truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for 
i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and let me tell you you ll watch anything under those circumstances not this piece of sh t though the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn movie quality acting weird out of the blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior it gets worse after that this movie does not have one single saving grace and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch it s just horrible i ve seen quite many movies in my life and i m not one of those snobby know all critics i mean i ll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they re bad this one man steer _well_ clear of this one my friend 
diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targets when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows she s found her home the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming of age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category 
dont let the mpaa fool you with their rated r for extreme violence there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s t i expected some cheap rambo type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense avoid 
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i ve seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don t know if it was their own choosing or not please please don t renew for another season as enough is enough bob
 slight spoilers a hunchback year old boy kisses a very cute year old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time after the act he lays in the bed with her not touching her the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency however as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a year old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother at one point his mother preaches to her co workers who are not as understanding as they might be every step of the way in this my son has been amazing i have never been more proud of him the young father s older sister who otherwise is cold towards her brother begins to show pride in her sibling you have been cool about this as she gives him an encouraging warm hug the year old father wants to be a father he wants to be a parent why not we see the new baby a few minutes after birth it appears to be a healthy happy month old infant just as babies were born on tv in the s and s once the young father is a parent he has found happiness he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper we see the year old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen s busy body mother is peaking over his shoulder fade to black 
i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn t live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it could ve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i ve seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that s pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i ve seen was juno so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either re make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential 
with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i can t imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i can t imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dante s effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producer s garris s valarie under the stairs but we shall see 
honestly the concept behind masters of horror had something going for it big time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again i was all for it from the start that is until i watched some episodes oh boy it s really bad tv not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits but there seems to be guidelines as well like shooting in hd for example to make a long story short it s bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons i cannot help but compare to the tales from the crypt and the m o h episodes really don t stand the comparison tftc was good moh is bad according to me here are a few keys to explain it tftc was shorter around minutes for each episode than moh minutes per episode i believe it allowed denser screenplays with good ideas reoccurring more often better overview of an episode less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc directors got to have real film music composers composers on moh are if inexistent very bad real actors whereas on moh it s nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor real directors of photography and it can help sometimes real film cameras while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens pieces the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt cinematographic in the sense that there was real actors being casted ranging from michael j fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas but there were also film composers behind it of the range of alan silvestri great directors of photography like dean cundey high end screenplay writers and in that sense each tale was a little movie of its own true kind compared to tftc the masters of horrors is quite a lame approach to tv horror it s very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial if not worse it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast within the first minutes usually the actors are never heard before wannabes except for fairuza balk robert englund angela bettis and a few but even there they are the only famous actors of their episodes the director base for moh was good in the beginning but it s getting worst and worst with every episode now if even the directors are unknown to the world what remains nothing and it s funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven t even had say stan winston dick maas william lustig sam raimi eric red robert harmon william friedkin jim muro stuart gordon russell mulcahy if even masters of horror cannot bring dead directors back to life who will maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will 
i was very excited when this series premiered in the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one hour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director then when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag i attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season would be a whole lot better boy was i in for a shock at least season one had a few good stories here and there season with the exception of the black cat starring the excellent jeffrey combs was a complete and total loss to me the episode sounds like may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last years and most of the other episodes aren t much better i really hope that season turns this around next year but i m not holding my breath 
some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series particularly the writing ok the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink i m a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing new or genuinely interesting few of them are visually creative it s just typical fabricated hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity other then that this series blows hard i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth graders to write the episodes maybe they did 
horror fans i m speaking to the over s although if you re under i apologise for what you might deem an insult in short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then i can heartily recommend avoiding these steamers made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date it s no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the s not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the s because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento carpenter landis dante and barker actually clive wtf are you doing in there glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i m sure he was asked to partake more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill advised tv remake of stanley kubrick s masterpiece the shining perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets sadly maybe so normally i wouldn t see the point of adding a comment that doesn t argue the faults and merits of a production i d just rate it accordingly however as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune i write this as more of a warning than a review don t waste your time and money if you disagree with me then it s more than likely that you haven t seen enough decent horror perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these masters of horror were being assessed on these works alone they d never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor s degree unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s t 
according to imdb takashi miike s master of horror segment imprint was banned in the us so i figured i d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer director takashi miike s episode in the masters of horror series and the dvd cover of imprint did in deed look very promising the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello some time during the th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american english but i will leave it at that it s not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miike s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn t help looking at my watch several times during the minutes the extended torure scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated and pornographically intrusive that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water and in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago for me most memorable as frank nitti al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables i ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago i m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh memoirs of a geisha who plays the deformed prostitute the finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind of you know blah and i looked at my watch again for the umptieth time just wishing the crappy episode would end maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but that s only because i couldn t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf and the upside down chins of craig charles and danny john jules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens lucky you if you ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you my first thought when imprint finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series and that if anything is a big friggin warning don t you think one might point to the costume design by michiko kitamura and say that there at least is something not lacking in style and refinement but there are so many other films and tv shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese geisha fashion this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed takashi miike s masters of horror episode is boring uninspiring and pointless in other words it s really really bad 
i m sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful so don t buy a large drink or you ll be running to the rest room my kids didn t enjoy it either ah well 
i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depp s in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip off but i guess tv budgets don t always stretch to this kind of acting ability i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn t done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise i took the dvd back to the store the same day 
there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate in the mouth of madness another carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film s namesake the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing argento s deep red claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop out this was bottom of the barrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine 
at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn t worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a if my wife and i hadn t laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier 
i m sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least feet those bazookas need serious site calibration 
the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours together i wont leave you behind the first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons in one scene they all have fake hk mp sub machine guns next scene ak replicas and then to top it all off they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m s i think they had a budget shortage for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell you have to remove the pin spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own you can t fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter weapons that you throw away don t suddenly re appear when a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid unless you have no idea how to reload them big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk 
early heavy war time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway inflation using scare guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war it truly is a window into the past historically and culturally 
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better 
there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe journalism tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein s demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the us have declared marshall law i m sure the papers here would ve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force aside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming so and so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they would ve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writer producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldn t roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearing this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists which are by and large unthinking herds anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think 
this movie was so bad that my i q went down about points after seeing it it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme 
universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return this film is a sci fi action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie i ve ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad they re good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them i m really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn t already but just in case don t 
no fireworks despite violent action science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts woefully so in the case of the latter with essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and in particular special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish while seeds from the scriptors imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first timer paolo mazzucato whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus 
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence only minutes but it feels like it goes on forever even die hard van damme fans like myself should avoid this one 
we open with colonel luc deveraux van damme the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond me it s after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going the united states government has cut the universal soldier s project budget and in the process angered seth the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers naturally he won t be shut down without a fight so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesn t stop it from becoming stupid as hell for instance one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg seems you can t go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie he s big he s tough right wrong van damme doesn t seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him once twice three times the point here lost on me then there s the breaking of glass a rudimentary part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scenes in particular let s not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck they have seth the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black michael jai white nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem potentially offensive and just downright lame he s no replacement for dolph either universal soldier is a lousy sequel it s loud it s dumb and it doesn t care the original wasn t anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level the sequel doesn t they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence so give credit where credit is due 
i first heard of unisol when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it despite their horrific criticisms of it i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd i wasn t expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us after all how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen well nothing could have prepared me for this it is so bad i almost cried what a total waste of minutes and it is hard to explain how bad this move is honestly this is idiotic film making no it s more than idiotic i just cannot believe how this got made i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered mic rogers how stupid can people possibly be firstly van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good secondly the fact that xander berkley of terminator and air force one status commited himself to this film i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof here is an example jcvd s daughter yes luc is now a human again i want my daddy seth so do i oh yeah and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge levers with wait for it on and off written on them the acting all round is like playschool acting i m sure mr director modelled luc s reporter girlfriend on april o neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtles she refuses to go because she needs her story i mean come on how many cliches can a film possibly use please listen to me fellow imdb users don t touch this with a barge pole to conclude universal soldier the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie in fact if they weren t called unisols then you would never know it was a sequel luc is now a human again what the hell the only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub all the new uni sols look like they were dragged off the street they are that unconvincing this is pure torture to watch so do yourself a favour don t torture yourself p s best part of the movie romeo jumps off a building and shouts oh sh t 
the infamous ed wood classic plan from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race stupid stupid stupid stupid i d have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie a ridiculously silly sci fi film falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie luke a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around so probably cursing under his breath the whole way he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks you ll find plenty of mindless violence but i d advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing otherwise you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it s over luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth makes hal look like ghandi turns all the other universal soldiers into evil remorseless killers of course this is what these things are programmed to do but in this case they are killing their creators not the enemy so that s a problem i love the dumb logic of this movie logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue haired cyber stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time the film also features a daughter in peril character wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier and a romance so tacked on i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing and when this movie ends it ends not a minute after a gigantic towering finale style explosion are the credits running no epilogue no where are they now no final kiss just explosion hug over even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible while it s no plan us tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths not to be seen on a serious stomach 
i was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film i didn t enjoy the first one at all and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports after managing to sit through it all avoid avoid avoid 
i m sorry for jean after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg romeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary truly bad movie 
van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horrible i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old finally but unlike arnold his movies are as well forget this movie don t see it ever i wouldn t even be paid to see this film stars at its heart lies a wonderful action packed thrill ride well maybe not but the marketers would sure like us to think so wouldn t they john ulmer
this movie was absolutly awful i can t think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot and dialogue what dialogue to think that i was a fan of the first one i use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can t even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time because it is soo hard for me to give a 
this is a piece of s t this looks worse than a made for t v movie and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results war is prettier than this jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now no script no story and no time should be wasted on this i mean that out of is too high way too high goldberg should be jackhammered for this van shame is no actor 
 here be spoilers the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program now called unisol the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before however the government is downsizing the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened so he takes steps to ensure his own safety he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem the only one who can stop them is deveraux van damme this movie is about one thing choreographed fighting the story is bad and is soon drowned in all fights whatever happens and wherever they go they fight unfortunately for this movie it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible normally you re pretty sure the hero will win but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants not where one is indestructible and can t lose then the fights just become a tool to stretch time you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes to further lower my opinion a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are well there aren t really that lot of them because the characters are most men there are at least one woman unisol though but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once the female leads get by with this but we also pass through a strip club to use a computer no less with much more undressed women these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent minded male audience so in conclusion boring fights no more no less well maybe less 
i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if you re reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film s subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that i m struggling if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets 
there s tons of good looking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudity free grrrrrrrrrr strike one ahem one story in this film takes place in then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage hello continuity anyone as you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic d and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen i m not sure if someone botched the job on this but there was no d just double vision blurs i didn t have the same problem with this company s other d movies hunting season and camp blood sure the d in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of d effect this thing is a big ball of nothing and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear eating dame yum i d like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet margolin at a young age purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 
i ll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it s in the imdb bottom and right now i m wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another check on that same list van damme is luc deveraux who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a hal to defend itself and yes after all the obligate explosions shoot outs and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set up it makes sure it s place in the infamous list is just only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list 
this is the official sequel to the sci fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers unisols in this one it s i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now he s working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols codenamed unisol for some reason as usual something goes wrong the on site super computer named seth like the snake in king cobra the same year goes power crazy takes command of the unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new super unisol body jai white we re lookin at the next step in evolution folks most of van damme s fights are with one particularly mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on comin drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him forgetaboutit much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out classed he s even going grey around the edges but though he takes a lickin he keeps on kickin most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if you re a pro wrestling fan 
this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean claud vam damme stars in this movie there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all and this movie by far has to be one of jean claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport kickboxer or sudden death over all this movie is crap ok and my rating is out of 
i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn t make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the original anyone ever hear about the old et atari fiasco for those who haven t let me fill you in it s et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn t even give them away let alone sell them what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the rating and figure it out for yourself awful film imdb forced me to give it a out of because their rating systems doesn t go as low as let alone into the negatives 
this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world i m pretty sure it was double team which convinced everyone that jean claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever while universal soldier the return isn t as dull as double team or the quest it s still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling as i look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud in other words another clunker in van damme s assembly line out of bad 
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him 
after seeing the low budget shittier versions of the universal soldier franchise i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie well it seemed this prayer was answered but not the way i hoped universial soldier is just intense as poetry reading at your local library no even that would be more intriguing the fight sequences are top notch bruce lee quality which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture that and having former wcw tough guy legend goldberg playing the villain however placing goldberg as seth s sidekick lieutenant would ve been better we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself it s like some film school students slapped it together the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west s ego is what really did this movie in for example luc s daughter hillary looks like she s at least years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago how is that possible tell me that the part in which luc s partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re goddamn diculous you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie c mon the director could ve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut but oooh nooo speaking of the plot it sucks compared to the first movie universal soldier s plot watered down and worthless where s the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something this was the dawn of the millennium you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia orwellian type of future cesspit corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad sad sad sequel from what i seen double impact under siege robocop and hell even the cheap ass no class terminator knock off class of is more entertaining than this 
jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier but did that movie saved him i think he goes to hell after he dies in the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad guy of the film scary huh but not as scary as the acting details are following then we see van damme with a black girl do not remember the name well it doesn t matter anyway trying to escape from some muscle men of course they are the new universal soldiers more muscels less brain just like the movie after a while van damme fights goldberg but then the mission gets aborted it was just a test is this movie a test for our nerves it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing that yould van dammes character could do but it is a sequel and a story has to come up ah i forgot he has a daughter very important for the story well after about minutes a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him it wants van damme as a soldier because he is the best really and guess what goldberg is one of the hunters who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked funny yes just like the rest of the film after some story van damme tries to rescue his daughter of his wife the reporter in the first movie it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie please see for yourself it is just too funny to tell you ll see that this movie is a waste of time so do not watch it but if you do keep a sixpack with you 
i don t think any movie of van damme s will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as st vd returns a luc must do battle again he tries b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them goldberg was cool he does his famous move forgot what its called cause i don t watch wrestling sucks vd goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the st but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like always the helicopter kick even though the final ending should ve been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original 
ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it s unisol s best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie who s been through countless hours of training and combat with him to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated intelligent and agile all of the new unisols which are faster and stronger than their predecessors are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth a self evolving thought helix when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts he takes matters into his own hands to protect himself killing those who try to shut off his power and unleashing his platoon of super soldiers led by the musclebound romeo seth spares deveraux only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours with the help of a hacker named squid seth takes human form not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin who won t leave his side but luc also must contend with general radford who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth seth has also kidnapped luc s injured year old daughter hillary and is now holding her hostage luc is the only person who can rescue hillary because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks feels and fights now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just so happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn t melt and reform him terminator another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it s completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you d rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier is like that the good points are there s no dolph hooray and unlike the st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the st one there are many i m still haunted by the scenes in also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists if you don t believe me look it up 
ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient that s it that s the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isn t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated don t you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isn t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i m a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didn t have to watch all the ads that was a plus it s a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish 
the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel since the real star dolph lundgren would not be able to reprise his role from the original there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write off bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white to their credit they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role for once his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times and it does not get irritating the problem from the audience s point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films and therein lies the problem you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action you go because you want comedy however unintentional unbeknownst to many people universal soldier was followed by two direct to video sequels i have only seen the first which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career the sight of jean claude van damme comes as a welcome relief the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct to video sequels and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original after years of investigation and explanation the unisol project is still going ahead with some minor modifications for one the new unisols are stronger and more damage resistant than their earlier cousins for another all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth in the early parts of the film seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut the unisol project is on the chopping block which essentially means that seth will be turned off seth somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down his only problem is that every so often a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown two individuals possess the code in question seth kills the first in short order and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme s films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be the rest of the film revolves around the unisols attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clich s when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity s weakness es gee seth you mean they will not be our strong points all kidding aside the short length of the film is both the film s weakness and its strength it leaves the action without adequate setup in the original we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols how they work and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film here the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate at least in the original a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice here one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body getting up every time without stopping for breath i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner if you can see it on the cheap knock yourself out this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre 
terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist polemic it s laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i m glad i did go to see it that s because i now have an immediate answer to the question what s the worst film you ve ever seen plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing credits i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldn t she think she could get away with the self indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson 
wow what a great premise for a film set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango gosh i wish i had that knack for genius yes i`m being sarcastic it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan i do concede they do exist judging by the comments or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawd to me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes it s a work of art because it has all the trappings of film as art yes it s beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease it s hot it has drama it s audacious precisely what this film is not 
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash it s one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally potter s disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing it s absolutely unreal 
strange how less than hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat uninspiring drivel if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter wouldn t you expect a little passion to show through in her performance her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance were instead awkward and painful to watch obviously revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness 
dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldn t be so bad but she s the director writer and star of the film and so is just self glorification i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether you re a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone statistically it has to 
probably encouraged by admirers of her much better orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually co writes the music including a mawkish love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her but potter s character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she hadn t cast herself it might have worked she just can t act whether playing herself or not pretentious over ambitious dull and silly 
the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims on the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a not so positive message about rape aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying the director satish kaushik went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way the director is famous for being chauvinistic his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya cleans herself after just being raped she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether ash s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confusing message about rape the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout the music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully picturised the only bright point of this film sonali bendre s role is disappointing and pointless overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion 
 but a lousy film as maltin says this was christopher lee s attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious too serious the plot is silly and slow something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times the film is sooooo dull the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee but this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violent well this has no violence avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep 
in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass this film was probably quite revealing in its day however i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica s bag since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan he organises the inhabitants into community action and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me as these people have far more important things to think about like where the next pot noodle is going to come from anyway de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are it s all down to capitalism of course and in order to illustrate this he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land brilliant to his credit though by this time he has given up on making a serious film and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures all fur coats and cigars they want that land but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense by a bizarre stroke of luck his old deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove he uses it to shower gifts on his mates who prove just as greedy as the cigar men i reckon this film was a missed opportunity to address the theme of poverty as not many film makers had done until then and then get caught up in a fairy tale to me seems a bit daft how come great directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks de sica however is proclaimed as a genius for this surely the fact that these people are so poor that their faith is unswerving and that miracles never happen to them is enough for any story teller to work on 
in spite of having some exciting and daring sequences nbtn just never gets going there are exploding boats hat pin murders mass suicides pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes but they re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition everybody in the movie looks bored this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed add to this the too proper brit characters and you feel like you ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie finally the cinematography is very ordinary there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull definitely only for lee and cushing fans 
i won t add to the plot reviews it s not very good very improbable orphanage on bala cushing and lee at their height some nice scenery good for face spotting and i quote look at the mouth that is cassie from fools and horses otherwise a poor example of the british film industry fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best redeeming feature it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription i won t be subscribing on this effort 
i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasn t up to his other performances and he was one of the better actors the film does not live up to its premise it s not that scary it s overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrived the evil ones aren t at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depth perhaps if i d been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstie fication at this film s expense but naaahhh didn t really seem to be worth the effort it wasn t really very good it wasn t really very bad it was just mediocre 
 three daring daughters is a sickly sweet rose colored look at divorce remarriage and single parent living obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing real life problems daughters suffers from too many incoherent high note songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself isn t it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married admittedly this movie was released in the nineteen forties only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make daughters a tolerable film 
in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than rem and usually much less of the men who flew to the moon of whom landed are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late s shepard would be 
i am a th grader at my high school in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch so we did i am firm believer that we went to the moon being that my father works for nasa even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched the guy who created it has some serious balls first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot and how dare he use all those biblical quotes the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates which is good b c in my class we have weekly debates this movie did nothing to change my mind i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie michael moore next movie could be called a funny thing happened on spetember th or a funny thing happened on the way to the white house 
this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn t there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo went through the van allan radiation belts they spent min s there not the min s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray seriously do some research learn what really happened don t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings or not old enough to appreciate them i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it i was a youngster at the time of apollo but i was old enough to understand what was going on the entire world followed the moon landings our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings on each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages in school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv during apollo the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate you couldn t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was the world was truly one community now with a buffer of odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down we are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days 
this so called documentary tries to tell that usa faked the moon landing year right all those who have actually studied the case knows different first of all there is definitely proof when the astronauts was on the moon they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon for geological studies these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs who tested them and they all concluded that they came from the same planet not earth because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth but similar to those calculated to be on the moon i e the conspiracy theorists never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing i e the flag moves there is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand so it moved and what proves this well if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be i e the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists they cant study a subject properly or only studies it until they have what they came for so that they can make a lie from that and make a profit i e this so called documentary a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources the artificial lighting from the studio once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong as usual the same would happen in an earth desert at night with no light sources but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck convention is held over the conspiracy theorists are in denial big time they only see what they want to see so they make up all these lies to seem important that is a fact 
the only reason i didn t score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically adept film that having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and sibrel s irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics i do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free don t let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity 
ouch this one was a bit painful to sit through it has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances alan bates and jennifer tilly among others played it way over the top i know that s the way the parts were written and it s hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock if you re going to have outrageous characters that s ok but you gotta have good material to make it work it didn t here run away screaming from this movie if at all possible 
when i was i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and non biased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that baffled me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most outrages claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt without the crew perishing from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollo missions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram s of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet ergo the moon landings where not fake nasa did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon it is a fact pronto but i do not worry most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon 
the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem ah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i d say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you ll see things a bit different than before first off weather data doesn t come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims 
there are so many incorrect statements in this so called documentary that i found myself shouting at the television bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims what s more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sites further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions all of the claims made by mr sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven how do i get that odd minutes of my life back 
i watched this video at a friend s house i m glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups most not related to manned flight sibrel s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video 
writer director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film unfortunately sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footage finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel s hacked up version of it he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk s assassination than of his smoking gun sibrel thinks he s the only one who s seen it what s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth as with most films of this type sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence 
there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of this also there is a statement by someone that kgb prosecuted jews gypsies etc which is worse than nazis kgb was looking for so called zionist agents who were kgb believed imperialist agents this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation as nazis did gypsies were never prosecuted kgb was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish between nationalities whole movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and on not recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead 
i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved unfortunately my hopes were dashed yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don t have a clue what they are doing at one point there is a laughable scene where kgb agents couldn t handle one cia agent i grow weary of these biased one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww and beyond just like the pathetic u where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine again utterly false to its credit the company is very well filmed and acted the locales are also exceptionally well realised alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton the conflict between them is very well done i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a s
i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o donnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands 
proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without quentin s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor 
thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage it s no wonder reb braddock hasn t directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn t deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they re told to do and they do it well it s just that they shouldn t have done it in the first place out of 
the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some brilliant stories but these were out of the frame reminded me of all the invisible children a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je t aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect short sketches together perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldn t recommend it 
from it s uninspiring title to the flat acting performances curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino s name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick from dusk till dawn these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through curdled the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it s becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesn t fit with the tone of the movie the film s plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes it sounds boring and it is william baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesn t make an impression he hasn t been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he s pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it s her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role not her acting ability she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino s masterpiece but she doesn t have the talent to lead a film by herself she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren t for her latino accent she wouldn t convince the audience that she s a weirdo on any level curdled is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels whether you re a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss 
excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already 
geordies salt of the earth characters bricklayers beer geordies happy go lucky adventures working abroad salt of the earth characters warm wonderful people tyne bridge tear in the eye brown ale salt of the earth characters cute little red indians children in newcastle united tops emetic geordies salt of the earth characters etc etc etc please this is so poor and you should know better timothy spall they can t have paid you that much as for jimmy nail well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an actor as he is a singer and writer come on jimmy the joke s over crocodile shoes and spender were very funny unfortunately i don t think they were supposed to be with auf wiedersehen pet the opposite applies 
usually i m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey haim s performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away 
well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late s this is one of them just one of the girls is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this if you re looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than this is about the point that haim s career tanked 
i d never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i d give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over years old and somewhat overweight not how i d imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vine oh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey cheeta was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan 
last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the films he made over a period of years no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride she finds tarzan and jane who try to protect her george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn t used to his full advantage also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often even the great robert florey can t aid this one of four 
the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller looking surprisingly aged a year after tarzan and the huntress is bad in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller shooting in beautiful scenery in m xico with a top star of that country andrea palma and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania and with impressive d cors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu especially the exterior built on steep rocks kurt neumann should have stayed as director instead of robert florey who gives it a very slow pace neumann had done a fine work with tarzan and the amazons tarzan and the leopard woman and tarzan and the huntress and finished his career directing the classic the fly the year before his death while florey became a television director after a career of few remarkable films if weissmuller looks tired the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others but the worst character is benji an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs that have a caribbean air in a location supposed to be africa and shot in m xico boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to weissmuller s tarzan 
the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one there are a few things that derail this film first tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals in my opinion any footwear on tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle second the character of benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil to me his character is unnecessary to the film s plot also while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan it s apparent that he was not in his best shape although in his later jungle jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this film the octopus battle is a terrific idea but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak likewise the battle which takes only seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to seconds to minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesn t manage to salvage this last weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run 
johnny weissmuller s final film as king of the jungle after years in the role tarzan and the mermaids is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans at the ex olympian one of hollywood s most active party animals was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry tarzan and the huntress not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role johnny sheffield the quintessential boy had grown to manhood he was a strapping year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being away at school brenda joyce at was appearing in her fourth of five films as jane she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan in s tarzan s magic fountain and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever produced by sol lesser at rko on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story when a young island girl tyrone power s future bride linda christian is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan he learns that a local high priest george zucco one of filmdom s most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living god if they don t do his bidding the girl had been chosen to become the god s bride so she fled faster than you can say is this a dumb plot or what the girl is kidnapped by the priest s henchmen and returned to the island and tarzan followed by jane colorful spanish character benjy charmingly played by john laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest poor cheeta is left behind after a series of discoveries the god is simply a con man in an aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island s rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion remarkably tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer dimitri tiomkin and is far better than what you d expect from this b movie while the film would provide a less than auspicious end to weissmuller s time in tarzan s loincloth he would immediately go on to play jungle jim a more eloquent variation of the ape man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier 
be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn t work out because you didn t get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just silly this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don t know and i don t care 
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i ve ever seen and that s saying a lot considering i ve seen such stinkers like demon of paradise lovers lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times there s nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women s areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stone faced monotone actor i ve ever seen the best worst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking who s the killer a disgruntled huggies employee i d have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didn t have a blast watching it
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman s club that s what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel they d add another scene with the workout girls and i d stay put as a slasher film killer workout fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big t a show appeals to you 
you know jason you know freddy and you know leatherface now get ready for the safety pin killer that s right in killer workout a dumb slasher movie if i ve ever seen one the unseen murderer dispatches his or her victims with an oversized novelty safety pin it is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing as the title suggests an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect in fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it s really just process of elimination oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the aerobics classes continue in earnest in fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing while three men are murdered in the next room the workout goes on death isn t even a factor one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout cop chases explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of women s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure much like the woman caught in the tanning bed i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout finally thankfully the end flashed on the screen what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them 
one two three four five six seven eight and back haha this is a must see first of all to see the work out there are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie it s a slasher but without suspense the ending is funny too and the clothes she s wearing in the wood confronting the copper jesus looks like a clown the killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory there are a lot of fight scene s too and hey no one got hurt and what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that won t spoil it you must see it and being a slasher there s a lot of t a too to guess who s the killer you will be trapped a few times and that s the best part but what about the story of the copper in the woods huh but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have i m glad that i have my copy one of those slasher failures but man those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles if you are in your s then this is one is back to memory lane 
big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i ve seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it s just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn t close for bereavement all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then 
this is quite possibly the most retarded s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other body stimulating fitness products if you d leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable s tunes there probably only have about minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health freaks with a big safety pin yeah the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you don t really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there s a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier look alike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest s beauty i ve ever seen looking through the credits her name s dianne copeland apparently and she didn t do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma movie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither we re treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide a k a killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific double feature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb 
what can i say a kamal hassan movie being horrible he acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction in my kind opinion the director gautham menon must give up directing there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes there was no practicality in the movie gautham is just running out of stories but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well the villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family you will not get sleep seeing this movie however harris jayaraj again did a great job and that is why i have given this movie out of his song partha modail nallae is soulful and soothing apart from that great cinematography on the whole this is just a bad bad movie kamal hassan i think should have rejected this movie 
i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal hassan he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better the protagonist raghavan is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives these two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham s name on the production list 
on the way back from imc san jose california all five mind you three of us hardcore kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year i won t blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan on vijay tv he said something like tamizh cinema la photography editing la namba munnera na maadri screenplay direction acting la innum namba munnera la tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to screenplay direction and acting while you re watching vv those words ring very true now here are the reasons to hate this movie harris jeyaraj harris jeyaraj harris jeyaraj i m barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember anniyan ghajini with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music the next time i have an eardrum transplant he s paying for it songs neither do the songs help move the movie s narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice the film feels like it s made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them a short gone too far vv at best is fit to be a short story not a hour plus thriller to use a clich here like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don t want it to the later part of a movie feels like a big drag kamal jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing there s no reason you would root for them to make it together in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration hate to say this but kamalini mukerjhee s minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus thenali kamal haasan s accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us and it isn t new either he s been doing it since thoongadae thambi thoongadae it s simply gets on the nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us he doesn t leave it at the immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered tn cops from keeranor sathoor and beyond in chaste kamanglish wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense which d c p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after the scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero s iq is he stupid can t he just use his siren or lights on a busy madras road kamal the cop on a police jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude can t he just use his gun the guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time i m not voting in favour of the later but i m just trying to explain the mood inside gore violence if i wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home and rather watch a police report or kuttram the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is even a double shot espresso couldn t get the pain out of the head 
filmatography excellent nice camera angles i don t remember seeing a movie of late with good close ups until this one could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera ny is pictured good i liked the upside down angles in particular a different touch music not impressive songs don t stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like anniyan a disappointment actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard core action sequences his age and belly really show up also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward it was a very awkward to see a mature aged star still trying to play like a heroes scenes love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much for example the love expressed by rajinikanth in chandrmukhi jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie not sure why she accepted this well that is not my problem i guess others just have a small presence direction i expected gautham to excel or measure up to his other movie kakka kakka he disappointmented me it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues he slips in few scenes even abvious things got slipped from a famous director overall just a okay movie too much graphics definitely not for kids and adults who expect some kind of entertainment thx
based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really apologized to them all of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of paris for example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldn t really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudo intellectual films don t miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it 
i pity people calling kamal hassan ulaganaayakan maybe for them ulagam is tollywood comeon guys this movie is a thriller without thrill come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs technically good but style over substance kamal doesn t look like a police officer there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie kamal at his best is the best in tollywood
it s the f b i starring reed hadley with an all star guest cast the film begins with an accidental convenient kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn t really indicate the main story which is a big house u s a prison break story the story is very improbable to say the least it s like a tv show only more violent for the times but the cast is a trip picture this ralph meeker is sent to prison his cell mates are the following criminals broderick crawford lon chaney jr charles bronson reading a muscle magazine and william talman reading a detective magazine honest you should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending voiceover if you don t want to have that hanging don t miss the opening scenes between the iceman and the boy peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic big house u s a howard w koch broderick crawford ralph meeker reed hadley
i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i can t believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money 
the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable but krista allen really rocked in the movie her voice was so seducing and sexy the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do krista really is one of the best in such roles she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last minutes which is the interesting part of the movie burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star he could have chosen a better script than this ireally think he did for money 
a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non heroes plan to sell to the iranians low rent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could ve been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half baked one liners 
about three minutes into this thing i started fast forwarding pausing only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women in ten minutes i was done and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa come on writers the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy s remote control that s the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past years burt reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movies this movie is just a waste of time run away run away 
i am a big s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me so i gave this a shot after all it s the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian i have watched much less of lloyd s silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i m a much bigger chaplin fan anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn t finish it i can understand why his sound career was so limited he didn t get very good material to work with after you ve seen chaplin abbott and costello the three stooges martin and lewis the marx brothers and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time out of don t watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend kelly the second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel 
don t get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds james woods and anne archer they are just glorified extra s their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasn t that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that can t be a good thing the action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yes this movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an action stunt coordinator of his caliber you d expect at least more exciting action scenes don t waste your time with this one avoid 
this movie had some great actors in it unfortunately they had forgotten how to act i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the make up artist needs to get another job the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the theaters cuba gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more 
an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this twisting and turning i speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the director s inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks and indeed it does 
i saw paris je t aime because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him going in i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting hours of my life sitting through this tepid production the stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non french feel the clich s about paris were endless yes most of them were playing with clich s about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clich s they directly and regrettably promoted them once more yes paris is the city of love we get it the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven oscar wilde the one with nick nolte the mime one the worst the hair products one the one with juliette binoche willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris the vampire one when i think of paris i think of elijah wood the one with natalie portman which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him on and on it went it felt endless i didn t like the coen bros one as well it really plays with those parisien clich s but i didn t find it funny just annoying the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely registered there were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman nice irony there and the segment about the african who is stabbed it s the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris the story could have taken place in any city around the world the last segment the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending the whole project felt forced and uninspired almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism all in all with only about to minutes of interesting stuff paris je t aime was an awful cinematic experience 
flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe inducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didn t figure it out after about mins you re not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll i don t mind slow movies but they ve got to be going _somewhere_ this one doesn t the plot wasn t what made this a direct to dvd movie that s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy the as of writing ten ratings must be from people involved with the production 
mst should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the extremite that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time 
it had all the clich s of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn t recommend this movie 
this movie was like a bad indie with a list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the s i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater scene s held off of the dock the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day 
this ranks as one of the worst movies i ve seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasn t archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad it s worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the dop that you re not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream don t waste your time or your money you re better off just staring into space for hours 
you have to figure that when the star s name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads cuba gooding j r some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of gooding s at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he can t have something on all of them can he 
camera work why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy this is annoying and distracting editing the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesn t anybody check these things and make them do it over again please reduce the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really don t understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard sorry to be so critical 
i rented end game having never heard of it but i m fond of political thrillers so i thought i d give it a shot after doing some research on the movie i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to dvd after seeing it i m thinking no wonder the movie is shocking in its unoriginality the plot and the characters are perfunctory i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball i have to say i didn t expect it to end quite the way it did but that s not a point in its favor the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse stay away i want the and my minutes back 
this movie looked good good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening it went downhill from there why was it filmed by hand held camera it shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer a poor choice indeed as if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all and then it commits the worst sin of all after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending doh this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director 
i didn t expect a movie as good as in the line of fire or an episode of but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best the good cast couldn t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best i think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other better movies in it you had car chases big shootouts romance plot twists etc etc this movie has none spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba s character you know who s behind all this and all the hints you re being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly if it were up to me and maybe it s a good thing that it isn t i would rewrite the plot like this first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time 
only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking one with fanny ardent bob hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris the others are so scatter shot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials it s really all over the place it doesn t develop over it s running time and nothing reigns the directors in no construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in i m at the one hour twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb over commercial overproduced vampire shtick it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment uh thanks j e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you don t need make believe crap to make your days extraordinary why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more over represented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clich s making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless the transitions get lost this doesn t feel intentional it feels sloppy 
spoilers ahead this is one of the worst movies ever made it s that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader an example of this would be when she said flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex s car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap i give this a out of the being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book 
how unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it i had never heard of this movie but there was cuba gooding jr right on the dvd cover and james woods in the background how bad can it be in a word very this movie starts o k has some twists and turns then just lays an egg the ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending how ironic a for a movie titled the end game to have such a poor one these are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry i hope cuba gooding jr and james woods don t make a habit of this 
so i m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called end game it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thought boy was i wrong end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring now being something of a whodunnit i can t really tear into it as i would like without ruining it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as why has he she they done this and where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off are all too abundant following the film s unintentionally hilarious conclusion as for the acting you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor s realised that they ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison of course this didn t make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling 
some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him he s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesn t feel like talking i can t figure out why it s not like anyone else is interested she s the only reporter there anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killer s sister mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later they re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage death a fake suicide etc etc lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can t figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked what s the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the reporter s even interested through almost all of this she s the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasn t exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agent is that the spoiler it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimes so what s the spoiler lemme think no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was p ed because the president was fooling around and she gets away with it she s really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested i give this move a it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber that s the real spoiler but even though i ve told you you ve got to see it to believe it 
this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldn t help but notice that cuba s acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general that s right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba s except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe 
predictable hackneyed poorly written foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing it s hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe 
please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her that s it undetected by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet which then enters the back of the president s head cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the psm comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involved ms archer the first lady is a craptacular artist cuba can t make out a painting and she says you re too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue 
end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we re happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn t make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering the end game was honestly one of the worst films i ve ever seen and that s saying something i ve seen gigli 
i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldn t believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else i tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it right or wrong it s better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that we re going to be subjected to end game 
cuba gooding jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u s president i ll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a persistent news reporter angie harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president s death and so on blah blah blah even with a cast of james woods cuba gooding jr anne archer and angie harmon end game fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isn t all bad and the story although clich d and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie well it doesn t the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters it s boring predictable and dull 
my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory however of the pages of reviews only a handful are negative i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future i admit i m more inspired to write reviews when i don t like a movie than as to when i do so my handful of reviews are all negative still that doesn t mean i m biased towards not enjoying a movie but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy paris je t aime is the most pretentious movie i ve seen in years by using an intelligent concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds it is art for arts sake but something that a year old could dream up and accomplish giving the director free reign of minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment directors can t write writers can t direct i d like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated but that is because he s an actor turn director which rarely works either what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don t make any sense are not completed in minutes and in total spoil paris to me why call it paris je t aime when a more apropos title is cluster f ck there are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by alfonso cuar n but everything else will fall into obscurity the coen brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar it s as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it as we all love paris present company included we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks in fact i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their minutes seriously seriously people natalie portman is not a good actress she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours and maggie gyllenhaal why are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies i m looking at you natalie portman garden state closer elijah wood sin city and catalina sandino moreno maria full of grace one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again find his short on youtube as his minutes are quite enjoyable writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right i m thinking of ernst hemingway raymond carver f scott fitzgerald and john cheever just to name a few it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this the same can be said about short films it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story then don t expect to enjoy this movie at all the directors either didn t care or were lazy in either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it praise be that you didn t pay dollars a head in theaters for it 
i guess its possible that i ve seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching he s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who s behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b list and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we ve come to expect from him poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor 
i argued with myself whether to rent this or not i m always afraid of renting something i ve never heard of don t remember this being in theaters great cast that s what tipped the scales minutes in i almost stopped watching it the first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable it only gets worse after that the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable i give it a a for the writing only because there are words and a for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script oh my god this movie sucks 
poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now it s europa another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment nor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her long suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman she s never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think i m going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is going bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post war rome but being a social worker with poor children doesn t improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse the film s overall effect is that it s not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she s two timing him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum ingrid suffers nobly through it all over compensating for the loss of her son but it s no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildly trivia note if she wanted neo realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak it would have done more for her career than europa summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman 
maybe it s the dubbing or maybe it s the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but i found europa to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films i ve ever seen the film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son sandro franchina whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ettore giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her role as joan of arc and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham fisted subtlety as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes by the final tear soaked scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of s flowers of st francis 
i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud the only mystery here is how oscar winner f murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script 
 ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn t have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn t make me satisfy so i can t be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don t know what do you think about this film 
on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the so called dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from grace is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman lesson just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin s own personal greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubin s car the main character s assessment of the car s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector s car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson there are numerous other examples in the movie of the car person theme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what i m really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if you re a car devotee 
first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired however it wasn t the preston sturges it was preston sturges jr the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson s short story the bottle imp a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell that s fine nobody said screenwriters had to be original the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen my biggest complaint comes with the ending the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film this is a stupid convention the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end in fact i think it s preferable 
the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f murray abraham was in it spoilers about halfway through f murray gets zapped because the darkling is some kind of demon like creature who enjoys living vicariously he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins however part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness that s what the little guy said in his barry white voice which i found both charming and amusing mostly amusing like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen dee plane dee plane bos here eet come dee plane all through the movie dee dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice saying things like it s ok to be bad you know you want it now you ve committed murder you re really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for being evil stores or something it really is hilarious in a sick way anyhow aiden gillen is no f murray abraham and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe or knifed f murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film he is a good actor aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical if this movie were a parody the ending was perfect if it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross out that the movie itself could not deliver the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending 
yes i sat through the whole thing god knows why it was a long afternoon i had nothing to do it was bitterly cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but they re the only ones i have i gave the darkling stars out of a possible i have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom poor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effects the storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family daddy mommy and little girl that i assume the viewer is supposed to be identifying with all three of them were tedious and annoying you just want the dark side to get every one of them daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious orient rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as the darkling during the course of the film the darkling is explained as being about or different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy because trust me it doesn t really matter the darkling s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion it gets a human companion and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being this of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who hooks up with the darkling and for the rest of us it just leads to a very long tedious movie 
i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy drama but i didn t it stars lucas haas brick alpha dog molly parker kissed the five senses hollywoodland and adam scott first snow art school confidential the director is matt bissonnette who s married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around 
 st watched out of dir brad sykes mindless d movie about flesh eating zombies in a story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in d wow not that has been done time and time again in d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that s what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we re actually bored throughout most of this part chronicle because of the lame twilight zone like easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale s the last story is actually the story the movie started with having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie s in that one as well well i think i ve said enough watch the classics not this d bore feast 
the film is about sir christopher strong mp member of parliament played by colin clive and his affair with the amelia earhart like character played by katherine hepburn up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn he couldn t help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the problem is that in the pre code days films glamorizing adultery were very common plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a th century romance novel and a really bad one at that sticky and with difficult to like characters after all clive s wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume you ve gotta see it to believe it and she looks like one of the bugaloos an obscure but fitting reference 
merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong independent lady flier who s never been in love intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn playing an amelia earhart like aviatrix who s been too self involved to give herself over to any man the director dorothy arzner and the screenwriter zoe akins who adapted gilbert frankau s book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clich s kept intact like frozen artifacts billie burke plays the type of simpering weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and hepburn s final scene is another bummer a curious artifact but not a classic for kate watchers from 
dialogue stilted clich d acting hammy clich d plot predictable clich d just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this b rubbish plummer was well established decades before this movie was made kinski had masterpieces like tess and cat people behind her must have been desperate the bad guys all have bad guy accents bad bad guy accents plummer especially where did he learn to do german and most of them have bad guy sneers as well the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh the good guy survives amongst other things a throwing knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all marines machine gun fire i think someone referred to a in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium first into a door frame a fall backwards from what looks like the third floor onto paving without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience the script has exactly clever lines the rest of the time it s all so dull and boring ok it s not all bad plummer does bring a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick of course that doesn t say much but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here he delivers his ve haff vays and meance type lines with some menace but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain this movie is truly an awful waste of time the acting such as it is is sort of s movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee s very obviously faked fight scenes but it s not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore or a bruce lee film don t bother 
but thomas ian griffith just doesn t have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow plummer s character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i d have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don t show any 
it s die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it s up to one cop jack crackerjack to stop this a b action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action a ridiculous plot as always in these movies and three fine stars thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists if you don t like stupid b action movies this is not for you 
maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun check isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen check tasty looking love interest check assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents check german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion check corny one liners check deary me does this film take the wee wee or what the clich s come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid we have all the usual action move clich s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point in amidst this mess there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels i have got to find these gems on dvd it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege and the second sequel well goodness knows one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character s name seems to change for the third instalment still blind purchases of cheap dvd s just would not be the same if studios didn t keep trotting out material of this awful quality 
wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad every time i thought that the movie couldn t get worse it proved me wrong the story was good but the actors couldn t carry it off also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done for instance you don t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing i thought that the characters wern t explained well enough you didn t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them 
where to start this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on and what was i supposed to hear exactly probably one of the worst scripts ever made i can t believe people actually put up some green for this film it makes me think i could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them finance a movie for me dolph was a usual dolph nothing else needs to be said the villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker if you really want to know what not to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this 
this movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi actioner the hidden and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one dolph plays a butt kicking monk who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for years he must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell the minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion possessed bodies if i m making this sound entertaining forget it the pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest too bad i really wanted to like this 
i can t think of much to say about this film this was an awful movie i can t even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i don t even know where to begin the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved the editing was poor the acting was sub par and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasn t it was just pathetic 
i have seen some bad movies austin powers the spy who shagged me batman forever but this film is so awful so boring that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest a pity boasting talent such as kenneth branagh embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham what went wrong branagh is a big time lawyer who has a one night fling with davitz her father duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes somehow i couldn t figure out how robert downey jr daryl hannah famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary i wanted to like this and being a huge grisham fan have read all about this movie and i foolishly expected something interesting this is honestly the worst film i ve seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded out of 
dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti christ is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jean claude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever they re on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgren s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i ve seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it it s awful and it s the lowest point in lundgren s career and i saw cover up the last warrior and masters of the universe out of awful 
the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to study dig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist the movie is just that a low budget b movie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along you ll follow the chase but you won t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a one man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one on one and it s supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isn t well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else the verdict of stars 
this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made what s worse my old hero dolph is in it and he s starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way it s carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you can t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost can t be a cent above 
come on let s get real the knights of christ ordo templi or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early th century the story is so laughable that it s pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored and besides if you wanted to have a real life templar why not just use the knights of christ who are still in existence in portugal at least they should have taken history into account the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces the acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay 
for two of the funniest comedians the movie was awful fast forwarded it and never got any better waste of time and waste of money tina fey is such a great writer i thought that she would be so great in the comedy the previews were so great but they only showed the best parts of the movie my husband even thought that for a chick flick it sucked what is up with that movie was very slow ans boring i will not recommend it to anyone at this time i would like my money back for this one boo from us here in arizona thanks but no thanks who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant i thought that it was going to be so funny i have had my own children and i have helped others have children it could have been more along the lines of reality 
what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot 
near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess i really couldn t say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone s time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn t taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine clich jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic as a story on finding love it s not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character s interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don t feel for the characters and don t find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula kate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes it s the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year s what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movie s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepard it s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn t necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade a hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but i simply didn t care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the script s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren t characters and that isn t our world in any way so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedy s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair i m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net 
i give this a generous four out of ten stars or dots or markers or something there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear greg kinnear moved along agreeably enough otherwise the usual trafficking in stereotypes blazing speed rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous anyway the two really really funny scenes involved amy p she s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way she s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball i hope they amy p and tina fey just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies then i guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role who s really there to help you be more human blah outta like i said is generous but no more girls ok oh i almost forgot the mom from two and a half men is in this movie and she s had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a year old so every scene she s in i m like trying to rearrange her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question no wait wait has she had plastic surgery because as a viewer you really don t want her to have had plastic surgery 
come on tina fey you can do better then this as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end sure it was funny at times even laugh out loud funny but there isn t enough laughs to save this movie i don t recommend buying this at the most i recommend renting it but thats all baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for tina fey and amy poalher made a good team mean girls is one of my favorite movies tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this but this isn t there best baby mama had a great supporting cast dane cook sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world after the great knocked up and juno baby mama looks very average when compared knocked up and juno are hilarious heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face baby mama s ending was unfunny and dull baby mama wasn t the best comedy of the year and it doesn t try to be i recommend it but don t expect it to be totally hilarious expect a average comedy that doesn t give the big emotional ending it tries to have i give baby mama 
i wouldn t say this totally sucked but if it wasn t for netflix i wouldn t even have this in my house steve martin s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he s just not funny he s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn t get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs 
a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it s creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie personally i can t do that with a drama and found this too far fetched i m particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no movie the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named magruder played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl mallory doss played by embeth davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken things are very odd she s weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until she s completely naked oh yeah also the father s strange the house is a wreck everything should have told magruder hey this is too weird for me i m out of here but not magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams set up then being the top flight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a year old magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him i could have believed begrudging assistance but no help at all not likely it s just too unlikely 
i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him quentin alias mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off 
an expedition led by hunky captain storm mark dana travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition they meet beautiful mysterious simira ziva rodann who joins them they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy and only simira seems to know what s going on a real snoozer i caught this on late night tv when i was about it put me to sleep seeing it again all these years later i can see why it s slow moving the mummy doesn t even show up until minutes in and this is only minutes long the acting ranges from bad dana to real bad george n neise and there s no violence or blood to be found this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics involving a silly love triangle than horror this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good everyone plays it straight there s some good acting from diane brewster it s short and the mummy attack scenes all three of them aren t bad they re not scary just mildly creepy still this movie is pretty bad a sure fire cure for insomnia 
 spoilers slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population who are at the time revolting against british rule from finding out about it given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt storm mark dana together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs sylvia quentin diane brewster the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin george n neise make their way to the unearthed mummy s tomb on the way there capt storm sylvia and his men run into this desert like princess simira ziva rodann simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life she doesn t drink water or get tired but also knows just what capt storm co are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig pharaoh s ra ha tet tomb as possible at ra ha tet s burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist s together with his egyptin guide simira s brother numar alvaro guillot already opened his tomb before capt storm can get there to stop them quentin violated ra ha tet s body by having dr farrady guy prescott cut his bandages this action on robert s and dr farrady s part has numar faint dead in his tracks it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet s spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age at the rate of years per hour to become himself a year old mummy the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet s tomb and it s surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive like a vampire of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with this blood sucking adventure by numar with him later losing his right arm goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance you in fact thought that he already found it to ra ha tet s tomb get s himself killed is an indoor rock slide we learn at the end of the movie that numar to absolutely no one s surprise is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another some years later person or life numar s sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet s sister since him and numar are really one and the same person but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti also not that hard to figure out with numar ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths due the the pharaoh s curse now at an end capt storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin s archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern this in civilization the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found and unearthed only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway 
the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy one by one the blood is drained from those involved in the dig to be as brief as possible pharaoh s curse is quite the lackluster affair while the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking mummy s soul transference interesting make up effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding to make matters even worse the first of the film s relatively short minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but pharaoh s curse tests even my patients the cast helps very little with only one exception ziva rodann is the lone bright spot wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay finally i don t know whose idea it was to put the mummy looking servant in what appears to be pajamas but it s a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh s curse i m going to rate it a not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems i have with the movie 
this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition i still can t believe it won and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q a section but that was also anything but interesting what s it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of official the first two lie about their professions but the third is the actual liar the second half do something else don t ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely different the tiff jury did were they drinking vodka 
as much as i dislike saying me too in response to other comments it s completely true that the first minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following having been banned somewhere doesn t make a film watchable just because it doesn t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i m in to my second package of rolaids as for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn t write one if i tried don t waste your time or money and don t confuse this with good russian cinema 
i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and get s you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for or very short scenes i wander if ilya wouldn t have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn t about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the iffr but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and frightfully bad direction therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 
the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come well i can tell you it will not come it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience i was amazed to hear that am i living in the same world he lives in ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all but that doesn t make me feel like i am losing my identity what does khrzhanosvky think that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch am i shortsighted or is he well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a a decent is my conclusion 
the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else i wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead 
let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more most open minded movie viewers movies are my passion and i am a big regular at my local cult movie rental place i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult movie area i love to rent strange stuff and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult movie video place he told me he thought i had to see this and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky one of my favorites atmosphere i rented it the vote i gave here is not really fair because i did not think it was awful i just did not know how to rate it otherwise a question mark would have been more appropriate this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach i actually felt physically ill am i the only one whose stomach literally turned still i did not want to turn it off or maybe i just couldn t because i was fascinated in a nasty way i do not ever wanna see this movie again not awful a as i said just not my cup of tea or wodka for that matter 
the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where i mean they could have made the movie in min short film overall the movie wasn t good at all and i don t recommend it 
film starts with people meeting each other in the bar ok they re talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason still ok from time to time they even make you laugh interesting first minutes you actually enjoy it but then things become worse nothing s happening for a long time and then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other not ok disgusting by the way this part should be the top of the movie but it s everything except that movie has no point it s boring and sick the strangest thing is that here belgrade serbia on fest film festival this movie was the most popular according to researches of course before people watched it i even thought before watching hay this might be interesting although it s a russian movie but god no 
the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute s return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitute s journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe that s supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don t include the songs and laments of the crones don t go to this movie unless you re fluent in russian 
the russian movie follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody s really up to here despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs 
i m starting to think that there s a conspiracy all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus ensuring unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck this movie is one of them it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it s rather clear that two things might have happened either i didn t get the message that is so hidden beneath this film s inner realms as to be impossible to access or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name is a dirty trick on the audience it s no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despite the rating it got on metacritic no one had heard of it it s terrible with sugar on top firstly there is the ever present number four from start to finish while having a little symbolism here and there is okay and it s been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies this movie is panting with it four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt four people in a bar although one of them is a non entity three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not while this concept may work the movie meanders so much particularly with the story of the would be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation or maybe like i said before i just didn t get it the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina s story which revolves on the death of her sister from bread chewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own the director doesn t invest much time in truly tying them together or weaving a tighter story that could in a david lynchian way intersect either with the past present or within alternate dimensions or even as a straightforward mundane science fiction story this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for weird s sake could endure 
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that s the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads that s when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep 
perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthouse festival crap trashcan it s not the greatest film of nor is it complete garbage it just has a lot of problems i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad it was banned because the censors knew of the russian film goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film so we have a strong opening shot wonderful sound design excellent premise laden with meaning and symbolism the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film s strongest aspects not that the number is a daunting visual challenge over the next minutes we have an equally strong setup an amusing and well written bar conversation among the main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of russia the human condition and all that then the movie starts slowing down we begin to wonder what yawn lies ahead the rest is quite boring simply put sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments nice sound sure but the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems and this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicely shot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the offensive stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch particulars of the national hunt much more rewarding post soviet stuff so yeah a out of for nice and symbolic of my post mediocre film condition 
the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat trader s story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent 
i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week and i m still working off the trauma essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising well acted too natural my problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless bread chewing hags it s rather with the fact that they never warned me the festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguing sounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending gum smacking to come serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews i looked at post fact um didn t at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful tousle haired russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following well i um thank you very much for coming to see this film and i just wanted to say well it s a very long film it took me four years to make it and it s i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it it is very long thank you for coming this is what he said alarm bells should have been ringing what s he talking about i thought in happy confusion this is gonna be fun of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again and in the end i can t say i feel in any way improved by the experience yes i absolutely loved the first half hour it was intelligent new and had a lot to say and yes russia is probably in a bad state yes every society has many hidden faces yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard yes yes yes i get all of this really i do but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging try the korean chinese bin jip iron it s artsy and surprising but also to the point and fun 
this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play it s bubble headed comedy but it s um squalid the plot is zany but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box the academy award nomination mean nothing 
 iedereen beroemd has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie it s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star the only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail the problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made everything is supposed to be funny but it isn t it is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole set up is 
i can t believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i ve ever wasted my time on it s just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh s character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham movie ever and this isn t changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don t waste your time here 
this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family s life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der gucht s singing 
mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that s more interesting than the movie itself this was chaplin s tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first two reeler here he played one of his last out and out villain roles although the feature length tillie s punctured romance was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself in fact chaplin s conflicts with director and co star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio chaplin hadn t gotten along with his earlier directors henry lehrman and george nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn t know what to make of him but everyone loved mabel producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer s films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a s a p so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel which looks like typical keystone chaos the story concerns an auto race in which mabel s beau harry mccoy is scheduled to compete but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and mabel must take the wheel in his place for all the racing around brick hurling and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest there s some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there aren t really any gags just lots of frantic activity chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance making a living but the outfit suits the old fashioned villainy he displays throughout at least it s novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get up and a more characteristic mack sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine as a performer sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked these films were hugely popular in their day mack s performance doesn t add much to mabel at the wheel but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn t kill each other 
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn t ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboat i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody s fault really i mean i m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lol it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i m not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 
this film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad not the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole film all in all one of the worst films i have ever seen 
in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can t recommend this one 
boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans mostly it s about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don t care an iota about if that s your thing tune in 
who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordon s legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clich s awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg s jaws started there s an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it s infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what freud s theory would be on that there s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can t get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts 
camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot this time they ve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness this time around there s a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea i ve seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how there s a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom i don t know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for just like they did in the second movie they still haven t worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well it s a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films you ll get some fun out of this one 
nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about times in this movie clearly the directors favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown s history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field signed the answer
this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen here are the things that immediately jump out at me the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush not scary whatsoever news flash if you are filming in the southern california area big bear is only an hour away they actually have trees there the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced every possible line in the movie was unoriginal clich or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame what is a clown doing in a forest anyway was that the only mask they could find the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph it s a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was not also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played kat good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself if for some reason you do see this movie i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids 
i should never have started this film and stopped watching after s i missed the really botched ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a baaaaaad story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branagh s southern accent it was better than the script the plot was stupid driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts 
after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early s even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine to this show s credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the s kitchens with vintage appliances and d cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in after the war had ended that s like shooting the first episode of gilligan s island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show s namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from through additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late s by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over years we get it we re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage 
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film 
this film was so disappointing from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love why is it called this i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time in the end the effect was listless i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasn t the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters you might say it was mysterious but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child the film has very little context for the time place or character i am not a prude but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover this film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving lulu s mother seem a bit boring the nail filing actually made more sense as it did give some indication of lulu s emotional state i will not fault the actors as i don t they had a lot to work on i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull i can t be bothered talking about it anymore 
del you are the dumbest smart person i ve ever met calvin well i had a brain but they lost it in the re writes i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov s work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here she s just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smith there are passing references to asimov s laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn t that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do 
waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting sci fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot technology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects can t help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also dissatisfied me will smith didn t show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like i robot and men in black 
i can t really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot holes this wasn t only laughable and but painful to watch even the action was boring a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children what a shame that sci fi this bad can still be made after we ve had bladerunner minority report or to a lesser extent dark city by the same director this one really belongs in the bottom list truly awful 
after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre pubescent teenagers today s well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it s own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywood s record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i haven t read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimov s short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprised this movie isn t even based on that story at all the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i won t point them out i won t spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimov s characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it s action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical i e unthinking who will state the movie doesn t have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it s title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and don t buy the rights to the works title it something else don t use the character s names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it won t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i robot like much of hollywood s take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this 
i just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that i robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling too i find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is is depressing depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid clich d re heats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modern day uber action to smith s character a smart mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and a few others i robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today s audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywood s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but i don t think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by today s standards but very b movie compared to true winners 
this is probably the most boring worse and useless film i have seen last year the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clich s the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she scientist you add a cent plot and you have i robot i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex audi converse etc this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after sec i wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book 
in spite of the great future design touches the clever asimov premise and will smith s dependable cool performance this movie doesn t live up to expectations the clich s come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites you know it s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but it s less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years 
the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time idiocy i want my money back and i got it free from the library sheesh i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again 
this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it s just been invented by i robot what happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop what happened to showing respect for women i e smith s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i ll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i m snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scene what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he degrades women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm what happened to hero s let s just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot don t get me wrong i m all for spectacle but i m also all for a shred of realism and meaning i have to say i ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques big budget action films you so have to die 
this movie was a mess it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream under the messy direction and editing there was a glimmer of something good a good idea a compelling spark but somewhere it went wrong the story is about a quasi psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest well the part doesn t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy he always plays the crazy bad guy very ho hum oh a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character grieco was experiencing and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords not a good sign for any movie 
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store don t make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking 
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don t laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don t know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim s house could have a baby with the priest etc etc 
i ll give writer director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill conceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for late night zoned out viewing only you have been warned 
a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up in the case of the big sky writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize winning author a b guthrie in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation the epic nature of guthrie s book and the evolution of its main character boone caudill from a naive kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author s intent in the movie version boone s presence is nothing except underwhelming intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie s novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie played by actor hunnicutt wasn t irritating enough so zeb hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voice over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and direction some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william wyler s ben hur is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself the story is dull and clich d and the characters at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie s literary vision and unfortunately kirk douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given if you can believe it the film version of guthrie s pulitzer prize winning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worse in my opinion the big sky further solidifies howard hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema 
anyone that has see tammuz s child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better let s hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot telefilm anyone and that is was a case of second feature jitters the characters are one dimensional and over used the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully the cinematography is great shot almost entirely outside the images are crisp and beautiful you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves technically this movie is as sound as they come it just lacks a heart 
not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say norm the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes the actors always seem to be fidgetting are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically you won t be compelled to walk out on his films after minutes 
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story i do not understand what they are there for they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks it s the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before every character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt shudder is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here as for the rest of the plot the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back yawn or karl who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock s masterpiece although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat 
i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored how can people possibly give this a it s not just that it s supposed to be a feel good redemption film i think because it doesn t work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there s just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow it s only an hour and a half but that s minutes of your life you ll never get back 
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn t deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham s name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didn t even watch the whole thing i decided i didn t care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about 
might contain possible spoilers not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion sure it s cheaper for them but after a while wouldn t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don t even remotely match up and iago is evil again since when i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films even the movie s musical number which had been disney s specialty for years stunk i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone even the very young all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality 
have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the tigers when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things at least watching for his her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren t doing the job lo and behold i spied wes craven s name in the credits as an electrical gaffer he d already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the scream movies maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as aesop a wacky character in the movie f j lincoln from the s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of tigers attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel 
the saddest part of this is the fact that these are minutes i ll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in my year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don t mind a predictable movie if it s done well but this one absolutely was not 
i just watched this horrid thing on tv needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get frankly i don t know how much lower the bar can go the characters are composed of one lame stereo type after another and the obvious attempt at creating another bad news bears is embarrassing to say the very least i have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is numero uno let me put it to you this way i watched the vanilla ice movie because it was so bad it was funny this this is not even that good 
what a stinkeroo this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second rate the supporting cast insufferable i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography and i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown 
this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever 
when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn t fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it we were misled in spades on my part i felt billy crystal s character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that s entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character if you re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you re looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it s none of the above 
shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended 
characters you don t care about relationships you don t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other she was actually somewhat endearing in this role 
i found this film to be an utter dissapointment the talent available to the director notably stanley tucci chris walken hank azaria and alan arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldn t really care about once introduced to the dire stereo typed characters julia roberts is feeble zeta jones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour crystal just plays his same old hyper active neurotic annoying alter ego and cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole project for what is supposed to be a romantic comedy there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible spoilers well the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack s role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever spoilers azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick dogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead spoilers we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog pure genius for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack s work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost gross out teen movie humour at times a very poor 
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtz s character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have the bottom line obvious plot one note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors 
billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it s a waste of my time 
in fact it never was i m not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a s screwball comedy what a vacuous shambles none of these people come close to a cary grant spencer tracy katherine hepburn etc and anyway today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck writing is trivial the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious the chemistry between the leading characters is non existent it s interesting that julia roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of hollywood whenever that may be it s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride 
the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it the crazy filmdirector the rest of the movie was just boring in the first hour or so nothing really happens jokes which supposed to be funny aren t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck yeah right into the girl next door where did i see this before who gets the guy for short i really didn t care what would happen with the main characters if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch 
i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it but this movie was terrible i have yet to see why people thought it was funny the idea behind it is stupid plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me 
it was disgusting and painful what a waste of a cast i swear the audience full laughed twice in minutes this is not a lie do not even rent it zeta jones was just too mean to be believable cusack was ok just ok i felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this mess roberts was the same as she always is charming and sweet but with no purpose the romance with john was completely unbelievable 
wow what a great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta jones hank azaria what s that a script you say now you re just being greedy surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary you d think so but no america s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another it s like everyone involved woke up before each day s writing shooting editing and though you know what i ve been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right i m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can so much potential yet so painful to sit through there isn t a single aspect of this thing that doesn t suck even julia s fat suit is lame 
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clich ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film what s even worse is the fact that is made almost million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this 
let me put it another way balls or how about bollo ks this is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise julia roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient normally she is the consummate professional yet i swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despair the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director chris walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors unfortunately that theme wasn t explored to it s full potential too little too late zeta jones was wooden cusack was cusack and crystal should stick to acting the two talented ex buffy stars had different experiences green hopelessly mis cast and balfour under used well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made 
and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that there really isn t too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn t very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing what s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film s lame romance the same with catherine zeta jones character the whinny self centered movie star zeta jones does a good job with what she s given but she s given practically nothing it s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we ve heard about stars over the years in the end it is hard to understand what made zeta jones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this 
if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt oklar as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt oklar regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating to much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt oklar was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique however in the end i found myself sitting down for minutes and watching alt oklar s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work 
divorced lawyer rick magruder branagh stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss davidtz who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there seemingly by her father dixon doss duvall rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick and he then spends the night with her rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior rick now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison but when he is freed by his local friends rick finds himself in a trouble trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life 
first of all i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply in my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant however the acting is near perfect in fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones like janset at least altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women and just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema just close your ears and o something real artistic i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach in short pros good acting hot women just kidding cons each and every single thing other than the cast
terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in that should be banyo what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil the dialog is cheap and sexual clich s are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much jeez 
this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i m sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don t know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don t do so worst movie i ve seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival based on a novella by science fiction author brian aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if you ll pardon the pun by mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha lose their way pretty quickly i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much plus the promised rock and roll just didn t move me i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch a film i found original and moving but in this case the songs just weren t as good nor were the main characters sympathetic a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine 
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time it stars shaquille o neil and is about a rapping genie apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece the movie gets out of 
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it 
this film proves that the commercial cinema or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille s name there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot what else the screen is somewhat dim o neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse rating 
there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam and he was whack his rhymes were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects whats next this movie sucks prolly didn t make bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp yeah you get it a stupid rhyming genie who can t act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects oh and its confusing as hell i m not even gonna go on let s just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh but don t expect anything spectacular 
yes kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity here we have shaq as a rapping genie yes a rapping genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him so yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy the main plot of the film involves this kid played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great grandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie who s been trapped in a boom box then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the shaq genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady gang type absentee father this really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies i e the two chances in life speech from father to son but it s shaquille o neill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all his plot line involves him when not getting the over talky treatment from capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career on top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box so is there a camp factor to the movie up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heart felt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material one might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing i d hope that they too knew they were just getting paid but i d hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq machine so if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker all the more fun to you hell it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel but if you re hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of and a candidate among many others for worst of the s 
this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in shaq fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film making that is steel there s not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i must ve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart it s fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness if you see it on tv try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him that s kinda funny and disturbing a horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie 
i feel like i m the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh s performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why u s actors were not cast in this film i second that notion it s wonderful when actors actresses wish to expand their horizons but it s another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but he s a such a great director well i really don t want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you d rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man 
if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here s some advice guys in a twist ending type movie it s not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists y know i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty i m looking at you if you re going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don t want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that s not a great idea kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i d rather they hadn t only for zombie completists 
what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq can t act people don t know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didn t really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i can t comment much more because this movie is so terrible there s nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away 
now i m one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say hmm this isn t so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really didn t start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film and i use that term sparingly was i even close to being mildly entertained to start shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting i hate rap music but as far as i could tell an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him the main character is simply annoying and not a character that it s easy to like quite frankly i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus bloody sores than watch this again 
let me give a quick summery of the film a rotten rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam a rapping genie like all genies he grants wishes but being good natured also helps max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime during all this kazaam raps from time to time also showcasing shaq s dismal rap skills this movie proves what we all know athletes need to stick to sports i admit that it never looked like an oscar worthy movie but everything about this waste of film is horrible the characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and shaq is only a quarter of the problem hell even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big no pun intended at the time i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws 
ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box gives this kid with shaggy hair wishes the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what shaq sucks at rapping and i guess thats it so mainly i laughed i cried but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player rapper and boy with shaggy hair i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh i m going to give it a out of only b c the movie is based off of magical wishes if i had wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn t waste money on making this 
reviewing kazaam and saying it s a bad movie isn t hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say it s bad or anyone else says it s bad is certainly no surprise it s like someone talking about wwii practically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place after all it s obvious to anyone who isn t severely brain injured that the film would be horrible but movies like ed a baseball playing chimp cool as ice starring the ever popular vanilla ice troll which doesn t even have any trolls in it baby geniuses einstain like superhero babies and pinocchio in outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school like the punk from free willy this kid is somehow misunderstood in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he ll have learned something and grown just once i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie kazaam shaquille o neal is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes but the kid doesn t believe him and the genie s magic seems a tad rusty eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real however unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant and according to the clich you know that by the end of the film max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed oh and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom s fianc i m gonna gag apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes as for kazaam shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap very poorly i m a middle aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well he s an amazing basketball player and i ve heard he s a nice guy but a rapper no way as far as his acting goes he wasn t great but had such a nice personality in the film that it s hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you ve probably heard through the first two thirds of the movie i would have said no shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script however later in the film the bad becomes horrid as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he s really needed and out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster and oddly this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation in addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad i know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film what part of trying to kill the kid didn t the writers not understand then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced hallucination this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole and boy did it make my brain hurt uggghh the horrible dialog was just too much to bear overall it s a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given the idea and actors it s hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse by the way if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good try the british made for tv film bernard and the genie a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish 
the only reason i dvrd this movie was because i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and i ve always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaq s outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my year old son and i just squirmed and couldn t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all it s terribleness we just couldn t stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam 
if you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of shaq first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid i would give this a zero but that is impossible 
this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball especially rapping and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a can opener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a djin and finally whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level 
i was given the book version of kazaam for my th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it s over soon the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he s bullied by neighborhood kids which i don t blame them because he s a little douche bag the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich about a boy who s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father even at years old i thought this was a stupid idea it s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it s an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot 
this is the worst film i have ever seen i was watching this film with some friends and after minutes we had enough the plot was bad and there wasn t a single likeable character i could get more entertainment watching static i gave this movie a only because the scale didn t go into negative numbers avoid this movie at all costs 
how a director of altman s experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a whiner a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work a monstrous piece of trash in addition to this crippling flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self indulgence with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer very unusual for mr altman patrick watson
there s only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra s character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible c mon it s shaq and i d rather see capra in free willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie 
this is one of the most god awful movies ever shaq better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny mst would have a blast with this one 
what a pathetic movie i won t waste much time commenting about it i m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it let me leave it simply with shaq has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both discplines it s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is shaq 
the first half of this version was the best i ve seen and i think i ve seen every version of jane eyre ever made the development of jane s childhood and character were exceptional then it was as though someone said uh oh this is running too long and hacked the rest of the story to shreds the major scenes when included at all are glossed over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end dashed it 
as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out at last i thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author wrong if the casting director was intending to cast a jane who was plain he certainly succeeded however surely he could have found one who could also act where was the tension between jane and rochester where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother finally why was the plot changed at the end one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book what a disappointment
i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didn t care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldn t imagine what mr rochester saw in her that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didn t hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the production the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the a e version which is not all that true to the book trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role 
oh just what i needed another movie about th century england which is pretty much like regular england only nobody s vandalising football stadiums in this picturesque setting of lords dames and other randomly chosen titles charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre from that novel nobody has ever read willingly jane usually hangs out in mr rochester s crib where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time one day mr rochester william hurt on auto pilot comes back to fall in love with jane and all that but there s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic oops that wasn t in the brochure after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire they probably rented the set the movie finally comes to an end everything looked really authentic that s something i guess but then again nah 
this movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of and and the three mini series of and and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely rochester standing on a rock and of jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life in addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other we know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane s reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for bront s superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out what remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to charlotte bront s masterpiece the cast is a mixed bag while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed anna paquin s young jane is more an ill mannered pout lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love the ever reliable joan plowright makes a very likable but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain looking hard working grace poole charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown up heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre looking every bit like thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role and during the first minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane s character any further as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues gainsbourgh s portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory this is a pity as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the version but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel his rochester besides being blond and blue eyed is a soft spoken well mannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically good natured and mild he is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous additionally during many moments of the movie hurt s facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open if you compare his rochester to the strong willed and charming protagonist of the novel simply bursting with energy and temperament it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt s performance still he offends me less than the rochesters in the and versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas george c scott ciar n hinds and toby stephens thought they could but failed miserably and i d rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played and i d rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today s couple in a starbucks caf of course this jane eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the and adaptations i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation you will not find jane eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie 
having read the novel before seeing this film i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte s work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story in the condensing of the film to a short hours the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial this is such an injustice to bronte s novel you are given no impression of jane s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her and his arrogance which attracts jane to him despite to poor scripting i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely namely mrs fairfax and grace poole however overall the production was poor given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful see jane eyre with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production 
i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and i would also say rushed it has been about years since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn t fully make sense for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage the actors don t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story the actors are good but aren t given enough time to do this story justice i m sorry to say it but i didn t really enjoy this version the version with susanna york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the main roles i love it so much i watch it regularly there is an abridged version which goes for mins or the full version for mins 
there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we re supposed to be pulling for well let s see we learn he s a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities he treats his coworkers like cattle gets them involved in his own personal crisis in the process getting one of them killed jeopardizes the safety of his kids threatens his ex wife s new boyfriend tries to strong arm the police and school administrators and all this for what because he was thinking with his little head i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp it would have made for a far more satisfying ending 
what was franco zeffirelli thinking was hollywood responsible for this travesty or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn t speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte s classic i don t think i can improve on a comment i read below so i ll just paraphrase it jane eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime it s true that this movie s two leads were sadly miscast but pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun deleted from the script the marriage proposal the fortune teller gone the allusions half joking half sincerely felt to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair eliminated it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane s interactions with the rivers family but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written do yourself a favor and go find the mini series with timothy dalton 
i read the novel jane eyre for the first time back in it was round that time that i saw the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldn t see it in this version no back to the bbc version a wonderful time is guaranteed 
jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book the whole red room is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the red room is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane s life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i m sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it 
i don t like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli s attempt to adapt charlotte bront s novel jane eyre is a total waste of time the script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet noodle worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick joan plowright s mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester s first wife the role of the would be second wife played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson is an empty cipher fiona shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as jane s aunt mrs reed she would have been better cast as mrs fairfax only amanda root as jane s beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability i saw this version of jane eyre after viewing robert young s for british television made in starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan and gemma jones there is no comparison young s vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli s wet squib i will be interested now to see the version with timothy dalton about which i ve read some very good things on this web site i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli s yorkshire picture book about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud 
this version is pretty insipid i m afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william hurt s weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can t believe that they eliminated edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the s version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched rochester s character the way that scott did 
what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte s brilliance of the original classic story i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful much of the witty back and forth between the main characters jane eyre and mr rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor also missing was jane eyre s charismatic sense of self which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all the original jane eyre was a hero the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr rochester her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of freezing to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie the title character seemed dry and uninspired the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story 
i can t say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven t seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn t quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it s like he sits in his little director s chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn t have it in him i don t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just don t have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure 
this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson s delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman s nashville lumet s network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don t help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly s sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don t even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i d been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven t seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn t know when to end 
that s not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now don t get me wrong here either i m not a total philistine i didn t hate the movie because it wasn t enough like police academy or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swear magnolia is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie there s some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me it s his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail s pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something it doesn t help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i didn t think so but i don t like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtrack s dire as well with that marrow suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though 
magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didn t involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i ll be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
i think i ve seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they re all very poor except for the rainmaker but this one is so bad it s unbelievable warning spoilerish it s one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do he s a lawyer for christ s sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes it s because all the police hate lawyers so they re just ignore him and let him be attacked when he s arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home the police don t bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they don t bother to interview his daughter as for the ridiculous ending in summary silly very unrealistic and a complete waste of time one of the worst films ever made 
 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn t get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it s an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful 
my guess is that this director writer had something to say let s see what it could have been a frog storms would be creepy b can i get someone like tom cruise to say the c word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter c cast my wife and get her to say the f word every seconds this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm the rest was a relentless over long under edited over indulgent failure glad so many of you enjoyed it 
normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film and as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i wouldnt if i were you its also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim observe life i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once avoid unless you enjoy tedium 
i wanted to like magnolia the plot reminded me of grand canyon which i liked different lives stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn t forgiven me and i don t blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie 
sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what it s worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to connect i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly it rains frog it was if the writer said i ve gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely oh sod it i ll just have it raining frogs i like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 
great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first half hour or so i was really wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these unredeeming characters and how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined but when the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill for the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it only got worse don t believe the reviews this is a waste of time think about it tom cruise made ugly why the gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces why i know it had to do with the plot but without them at least there would have been one attractive cast member to remember 
 magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can t care for others except for john c reilly s and philip seymour hoffman s characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller stahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas anderson s ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann s coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we can t see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn t know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn t hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree 
i can t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non existant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles fort a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode don t waste your time it would be better spent reading well anything to be honest
the minute you give an art film you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood i won t try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you hours of pain the following a children s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show s star contestant decides that he doesn t want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game show s producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producer s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses hours and becomes classified as a modern epic you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel 
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children s comic i gave it out of for it s attention to detail because for the most part it had a s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn t common knowledge well that never happened 
this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it s good it s just bad 
i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlie s angels really that boring i don t seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasn t unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasn t that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husband all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was dialog that s pretty much it not awful not the worst of tv movies but missable 
it was everything this isn t it had pace pop and actors who weren t afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isn t really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they weren t industry names but they weren t exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he ll create a show for her obviously did not happen what bothered me was how spelling s role is distorted he s shown as the show runner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughable how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah s oral contract when the others were signed and why didn t farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid that was where the three s company pic delivered 
noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an under appreciated gem as i regard many films from the s this is no gem not even semi precious the anachronistic clothing and s rolls royce limo hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components aren t mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesn t come together like it should and that s a shame with a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good movie the film is about an american showgirl jean harlow seeking a rich british husband preferably from the nobility she meets franchot tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy s employer harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction however tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german th columnist on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a mata hari type benita hume and harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of tone s murder in fact tone recovers from the wounds harlow flees to france where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy french cad cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant s hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash in the following scene tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold digger harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movie plot device break downs in the story then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman hume who shot him she is on hand to watch her paramour grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both hume and tone dimly recognize each other but simply can t place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse this is inexplicable and unnecessary hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn t able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issue the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to preserve the french public s perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant s reputation meanwhile harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow rekindles feelings for him too at film s end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant s death after grant s hero s burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade out that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long suffering first husband reunited with harlow it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been 
this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i ve seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case i m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too i m glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in work notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing don t buy it 
sadly this is not the best british gore film since hellraiser though the dvd cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it it is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the amicus stable cradle is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie can be done so much better every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece the gore content is quite frankly laughable from the opening shots where we see a man s obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all the acting is abominable from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf via dani filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs look out for the mental asylum a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell i have seen it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering nay running away at any available opportunity i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running it does however mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth s breasts which i guess is one um two things it has going for it once that s out of the way though it is all downhill i ve heard people say good things about alex chandon and i would love to believe them but on this evidence i m not likely to if you want a decent homage to amicus avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead currently battling it out with blair witch book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen 
it surprisingly had a plot i ve seen movies with less plot i don t wanna mention asian movies but i thought the camera wasn t bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasn t too bad there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes the acting was bad but i ve seen worse the movie was bad but i ve seen worse watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low level so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you i gave it because it can be entertaining if you don t expect to see a good movie and you re in the right mood 
not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not it s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it s that it s not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it s boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it s worth hearing though this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere 
the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the non directors cut the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there as a horror movie it doesn t work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part 
by all accounts this could have been an interesting film featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as the future of british horror i expected alex chandon s gore fest to live up to the hype i was wrong everything about this film is either cliche or inept the short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties admittedly the idea of the sick room did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting chandon cannot write dialogue every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence the typical cop on the edge formula funny i m sure i ve seen that somewhere else before no chandon you are not tarantino or scorsese it sounds bad add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting don t get me wrong dani filth is a great singer and musician but actor he ain t and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing give me bruce campbell any day the visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious cgi awful gore effects for goodness sakes peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing filters that shriek over use as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth s score man they should sue the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects eg maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc rendering cradle of fear in my mind second rate and obsolete i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares better luck next time 
normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b horror movies to me the basic principals behind a b horror movie is it s camp value heavy gore lots of needless nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex i rented cradle of fear strictly because i ve been a fan of the band since they released they re first demo in the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn t laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi hundreds of dollars the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the hardcore goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps that was really it to me this movie seemed like of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this movie really is just an extended cradle of filth video 
i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss altman s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didn t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didn t ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender mercies but the great santini this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a out of 
this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie admittedly i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie for being low budget the special effects weren t bad either the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish now on to the cons there is very little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development it s hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters when there was a little talking the f bomb was abundant popping up in random places yes i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language the storyline what i could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what s happening in the end cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn t work too well rent it though if you re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite 
this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think he s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still i m generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed i m in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do like i got home and popped it in my patience lasted minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then that it looked like it was shot using a hi camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani m height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i haven t finished it yet so i wasn t positive after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back yes it took me years so dani in fact was funny as satan manson super evil man s helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess he s just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it we have a couple of short stories joined by dani s character my favourite was about a guy who steals someone s leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly the acting s rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stinger s cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is let s just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example dani the man filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his size you might think after my comment that this movie is so bad it s good but it s just bad cradle of filth fans can add points i added one for gore 
this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever and believe me that s hard to achieve especially when you re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies i m not a cof fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie a really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for it s crappiness watch it when you re in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you re high on multiple different types of drugs 
 and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way first of all it s a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes your wildest imagination doesn t even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out now i love horror movies and i am very pro violence but i do think that it has to lead somewhere is that too much to ask cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts the movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story this results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common not very informative if you ask me and yet it has to be said the basic plot idea surely has potential it s about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial personally i think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess they didn t have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts tons of it the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i ve ever seen any other special effects besides the make up looks very amateurish like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example there s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere not even an attempt to build up one cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least with the presence of death metal icon danni filth from the band cradle of filth get the link this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing bah i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you re easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind for every self respecting horror fan this movie is an insult 
cradle of fear this isn t a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack jacked uttering that sense of whoa what it is though is a slice of lo fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director alex chandon as a throwback to sleazy s and s horror this is a very visceral experience for hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth lead singer of the metal band cradle of filth executing a role he was destined to play as other s have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer kemper the father of our devilish avenging angel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum what this provides for the chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached we are also treated to close ups of skull s being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror and for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking did i just see what i thought i did because of course pretty woman this aint it reminds me of some of the gore fests created out of italian horror some to years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed story of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the sick room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in film making as a viable form of supporting visuals using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film ok classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is 
this sure is one comedy i m not likely to forget for a while wouldn t normally bother to comment on this movie it s so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it s kind of popular in p p sharing networks such as kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is so what is it then well of course it s not really a comedy instead it s intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they re especially pathetic and as for the acting well let s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one s expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned also even though i m a big fan of the horror genre i m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting but still b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances if you can find the humour in that and i could for the first minutes or so gradually dozing off after that then that s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer oh that and two or three pairs of breasts woohoo how exciting as for the story it s not even that it doesn t try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime the lesson watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you ll be made to pay for what you ve done i rest my case so all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock n roll i rate this one out of but would go to if i could or perhaps i wouldn t it deserves a for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles i mean that s something innit 
now look i won t lie to you but i only got this movie for from a friend because it had danni filth the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band cradle of filth in it i expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot line but dear god i was oh so wrong this movie seriously bites big time being a low budget film haha wait make that zero budget this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects nope it s all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenes take for example when our star and violent fiend mr filth violently kills a mugger a grab at the throat and blood spits out but oh my it looks like there s a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man s shirt to you cradle of filth fans you ll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song down my final comment steer well away from it it s blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it so if you like appalling violence near no voices yes there s hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it but if shoddy movies isn t your thing then avoid it don t waste your money 
check out the film s website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it couldn t be more off in it s boasting original story original they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn tooting high end special effects come on i could do better with an atari and a jug of earwax stylish cinematography oh yes the america s funniest home video look is still a classic i m sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren t really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it s the story that makes this film a waste of time and money stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen befores and done already s 
i didn t know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but there s only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie 
this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it all aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre the acting by the three leads is wooden i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange the dvd transfer is typical alpha 
did anyone who was making this movie particularly the director spare a thought for the logic of the story line these are not mere plot holes but plot graves that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight that is if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave hole plot or boring and unlikeable or in the case of downey s hannah s characters apparently superfluous in pondering the reason for existence of downey s character s significant screen time in the movie i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen time unlikley as the director didn t change anything else about the script he actually needed to or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting i ll leave you to guess which one it was to be i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job surely he has some power to pick and chose actually i can t understand why anyone would take this script on except a first time director looking for the experience i suppose robert downey jr needed the money for his habit i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie as for robert altman plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye s movements or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood i do not typically notice such things in movies since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story telling and interesting characters with understandable motives i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that due to the talent involved there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie nice direction but that s not why i watch movies 
this was a disappointing film for me it came to me via a boxed set entitled classic film noir which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style i insist that noir is a style not a genre i do not think it is a noir film at all there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from to as noir and the label does not always fit there is a persecuted male protagonist ed cullen lee j cobb and most of the film s action takes place indoors those are just about the only noir elements that i could see there is no pervasive paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers however i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it 
maybe i m missing something because i ve read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews and i just don t get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir archetype as you ll find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i ve seen in a while she s just not convincing in the role as for the plot it s tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it 
i watched like or herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me i watched several documentaries about him he is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and passion for making them but does this makes him a good director definitely no a complete anti talent he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits but a film with actors never he can t direct nor write his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations and many situations dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word art in any sense no way not to mention the unskillful direction so amateurish like to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store who is he kidding he is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction just look at julio medem if herzog can make a movie like medem can then i might re check his old movies and try to find talent in them 
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u this movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing a really very big disappointment
the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take hours of my life actually it was only minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema all i have ever seen were few older movies of s ray browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment oh my how wrong i was the only logical explanation for this rating of is that most of people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies with this rating this movie would be ranked on th place on imdb list of best movies above citizen cane goodfellas of psycho i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music 
i love the munna bhai mbbs but lagge raho sux really sux i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers may be spoiler an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai people discussing their personal prob on phones come on man from which part of the world u r i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible out of stars is for mins good starting 
let s see where to begin bad acting i m not sure if i d even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read the actors didn t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn t save this movie from it s lifeless characters to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than i ve seen in a home shot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i don t care who directed it i ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom don t waste your time or you ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings you ll see the s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed s with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suck fest 
this is a film that makes you say things i can do much better than this acting writing and directing this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others looks as if it was shot with my flip video i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film one of the worst movies i have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials 
with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler the art of seduction fails to deliver the romantic sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as the two main characters have the potential to be interesting both male and female lead are swinging singles or in the female lead s case engaged but the art of seduction doesn t even try shirking from a frank examination of these two characters personalities the art of seduction eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin lean stereotype the art of seduction is insulting insulting to its characters insulting to men and women and insulting to its audiences expectations it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them ji wan is an immature spoiled manipulative bitch the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she s pretty min jun well he s exactly the same neither are nice people the humour in this film primarily revolve around ji wan and min jun s outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation no character development occurs and we never learn why ji wan and min jun are like this we are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions they re cute and that s all that matters the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester s reviews may tip you off to art of seduction s shallowness if you re still in high school you liked grease or you are a yellow fever victim you may like this movie despite its romance tag this is not a very good date movie 
a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfield s slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think `why am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching just my opinion 
in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often the plot is unrealistically convoluted the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman s participation amounts to collecting a pay check once again he has assembled an impressive cast like woody allen everyone wants to work with altman that this time around to the letter is miscast but that s only part of the problem kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film s heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex husband and a loony dad with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that s not enough there s a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he s blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going hipster bob downey jr is every bit as bad as a p i but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible the female leads embeth davidtz darryl hannah famkhee jansen are lean leggy and unemotive even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos vernon jordan are wooden with the few throw away lines they have in addition to paying little attention to his actors altman s mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless his action scenes comic book it lacks his offbeat touches and observations he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia that make a well done altman so unique unfortunately gingerbread man is altman at his worst even if the pay is the same 
bill buddy rogers is sent to new york by his uncle richard tucker to experience life before he inherits million his uncle has paid women jacqui kathryn crawford maxine josephine dunn and pauline carole lombard to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold diggers one such lady cleo geneva mitchell turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the months that bill is in new york while bill meets with cleo and another woman at the end love is in the air for bill and one other the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice rogers isn t that good either he s pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver roscoe karns and the film is just dull 
i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so invariably my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me in any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves the scene at bishop myriel s was fine in fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of fantine because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the mayor s office and spit on his face bamatabois is entirely eliminated because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about tholomyes is fantine s dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering as cosette and valjean are riding through the park they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting about prison reform when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we aren t revolutionaries i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave of course they are revolutionaries they want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters it s a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine except not eponine or at least not the eponine of the book this eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms the prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn t good enough anymore so they re going to build barricades i don t know about you but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades etc eponine does die for marius thankfully the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that javert s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown he saved the man s life earlier why let him die now then there s the whole skipping of valjean s confession to marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side overall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene the elimination of fantine s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her that cosette knows valjean s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal i did not even see thenardier and mme thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time the same with gavroche i did like frederich march s interpretation of valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with javert the lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many javerts i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character again this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book purists though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before 
here s an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that isn t worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasn t worth the extra effort ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from evil dead and the matrix as a result there s very little in ozark savage that hasn t been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course there s no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to minutes director matt steinauer shows great promise and i wish him luck 
many people thought that this is a good movie but i don t agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i can t see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the sound after a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only minutes long the summary is too short and it can t tell the reviewers about the story clearly in conclusion i don t think this is a good movie 
i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to o herlihy s awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility the old b w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for 
saw this film recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with coolio totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached worse than spawn long live evil dead ii 
what the hell of a d movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across the only cool thing here was coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring it s not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones well ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider out of 
this movie is bad it s basically an overdone copy of michael jackson s thriller video only worse the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie 
this film is so much of a rip off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent if you think this film is good then you havn t seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons 
lame lame lame a minute cringe fest that s minutes too long a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue that s straining oh so hard to be hip mostly it s just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat a sample of this movie s dialogue after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau s vigilante character she `any questions hyuck hyuck hyuck bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the director s watched `the evil dead way too many times i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they ll never get back what a turd 
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen while featuring good actors the movie doesn t live up to the expectations the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known good actors loud and dramatic music it doesn t change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch earned itself a score of 
this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle 
my friend s mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home the convent a horror movie i couldn t wait to watch it given that it s supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious i can say that in some weird way i like this movie yes the acting is bad and yes it s the cheapest movie i ve ever seen but it s so damn funny what are you smoking ca rack i didn t know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad yeah so overall the movie is pretty bad you gotta admit that much at least but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of it this movie kinda sucks but it s good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the dagger of despair the dagger of despaaaaaair 
this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen from the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission as it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non chalonte manner with pledge over reacting and over doing the whole eager to be popular role what really took the cake with this one is the final battle absolutely horrible special effects with the guns for example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and vice versa this is accompanied by stop animation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about guns that come out of nowhere overall this movie is crap just like so many others you can rent for cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place 
this film wasn t programmed in italian cinemas i have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestival i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there s no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i don t have words to describe the visual effects if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review 
in fact these young people were so distasteful that i couldn t wait for all of em to get slaughtered and that includes clarissa joanna canton since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background it had nowhere to go but down even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing i m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since it ll appeal to that bunch it sure didn t appeal to me blah and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still looks hot though i m glad she takes care of herself since we don t get to see too much of her nowadays however it is a step up from dante tomaselli s meandering horror in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so i ll give it that much that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film lion s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up out of 
when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the probable chance that i ve not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without realising that it s actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here more s the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittens following well worn clich s the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked but you ll never guess what happens next a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly haven t you got better things to worry about the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger it s far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you d see in the buffy the vampire slayer tv show aren t really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know it s funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest i ve had more fun in a dentist the convent isn t really a horror movie as such it s more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but you re laughing at it instead of with it i honestly can t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much they d enjoy it i don t enjoy the so bad that it s good genre i personally feel that if the film makers can t be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn t bust a gut trying to watch it yes it s a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive a rubik s cube for example the dvd box has two price stickers one for and a reduced price of but it was sold for and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of unholy crap 
i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record i m not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really dug about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just can t make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasn t a good time 
 this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it it s also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn t let the film down it s also terrible 
this film is absolutely horrific one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the special fx only make you laugh the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn t quite get the point if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs especially when the first special fx appear on the screen but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must see for you 
worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon i suppose that this is a horror comedy i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie the special effects were not so special i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house i wish i could have something good to say about this movie but i am afraid that i don t even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey i do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended 
rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings actors of stature robert duvall robert downey jr are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee stained camera lens a writer john grisham who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of under motivated incoherence the film has a cheap lecherous feel about it but barely at the level of commentary its really part of the aesthetic normally i come on to the imdb to write balanced generally appreciative comments this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless bilious rant i won t but only because i no longer want to occupy my mind with this trash 
i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you re looking for cheesey you may like this i myself don t mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick 
i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probably enjoy that as well 
this movie is awful i don t even know where to begin i m speechless i can t even describe how awful this is the blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was rediculous i don t see how it could even get a vote of its so bad it looks like it was made by highschool students 
this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbuster approved edit must have looked like because the director s cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you don t expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handy also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully under exploited i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasn t a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fuller s covered junk and truly upsetting haircut and there s huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in bring it on and acting about as well there s always a silver lining kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button 
 voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you re not interested in the male form stay away burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days 
i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremes it is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish a blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs 
i know you ve read that before on countless other films no doubt if you re reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i ve been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones aren t even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it s fair to qualify that i m not just some dumb renter who picked badly i ve seen two thirds of the bottom ranked films here on the imdb and i m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this excersize in absolute monotony i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isn t that bad if you can watch it with one single friend it s bad but could be a lot worse it took of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films spotting the boom mic for example times in this one if i m not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes i d watched it but i d also forced of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around this i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes but it isn t a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money considering inflation and was an utter gem it s not an excuse for how bad this baby is spoilers ahead it s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging no matter what your alignment or sex rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time the acting is cheese but not overly amatuer i ve seen a lot worse in better films but somehow it s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you ll ever hear in a film that really grates rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair it s an endurance test you probably want to skip i m sure there is worse but i wouldn t be surprised if it has decoteau s name on it 
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller i don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion 
if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after minutes of touchy feely but no action a few of the actors i ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great rondo whom performs all the magic whit his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving 
cheap and mind blisteringly dull story and acting not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable the homoerotic overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers i m not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake 
what s up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a lawyer s office where everyone works by candlelight don t waste your time in fact don t waste your time with anything altman makes it s all a pretentious waste of film 
pros nothing cons everything plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn t act to save their lives and gore that s more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually transmitted disease my last cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this my rating out of if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion 
you can t hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and i had expected it to be campy anyway it s not all that campy in reality with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter who don t take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight riley smith is exceptionally bad the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra low budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and physicality in the script to get their point across although it s possible that the story is important only to explain why there s so few cast members nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft core homoeroticisms which aren t all that edgy i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason the film is grainy with a tv quality look and acting level there are a few sexy scenes that are alright the boys writhing in bed in their boxers feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them and some of them are kinda funny and i liked the digs at l ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones but it still isn t any good 
and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of it s just barely legal guys rubbing themselves could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i ve ever seen it s like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans it s the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort 
i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don t wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i m not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don t need you i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize 
rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesn t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless she is played by collen haskell there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations schneider s performance is a so so the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie 
i hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it aimed at an age group of this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied worth no more than votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste hours of their lives 
guy is a loser can t get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn t even finish the last minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i ll be nice 
redundant but again the case if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics in this case schneider then you should go basic comedy man s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him unfortunately he takes on each animal s characteristics former survivor colleen looks pretty good here now that she doesn t have open sores on her legs and a little makeup on her face d
i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever it s one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg while not being kid appropriate the jokes aren t just low brow or f t jokes they re crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg rating too bad it might have made a bigger splash as an r rated film if the funny was left in overstatement probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of time and i m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding down and boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesn t salvage the rest of this quagmire tourist trap of a rental star glad i saw it as a freebie would have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe 
nothing in this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong there is simply nothing funny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer s yard is not funny it borders on obscenity they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funny we all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not funny it becomes a cliche rob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that he s not a bad actor but with rotten material it s difficult to comment on quality however coleen haskell the other half of the human romantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material 
this is a very bad movie i laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring through the whole short movie i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end no one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous rob schneider acting like an animal isn t something i would pay to see it looked funny but the bottom line don t waste you re precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie i was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse stupid all the way to the end i walked out of the theater and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever the writer and co producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer but this is nothing like the simpsons this movie sucks 
this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever i laughed so much my ribs began to ache the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes seeing as this was based on a manuscript by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as the firm or the rainmaker 
i saw an interview with rob schneider who plays the lead character marvin mange in this film he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you d be laughing at this movie obviously that must be the secret i had the volume turned up i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster and completely unfunny a major disappointment after schneider s hilarious performance in deuce bigalow male gigolo the story is stupid mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr wilder michael caton and as a result starts to lose control of his animal instincts this makes him a supercop he can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses of course he also has a nasty habit of eating people s cows and trying to seduce their goats but surely that s a small price to pay it just didn t do anything for me the cast left much to be desired is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley here he plays sgt sisk mange s commander on the police force as a repugnantly cartoonish character much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series scrubs i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell s first serious acting job can anything in this movie be called serious she of course gained her fame as a contestant on the first survivor and she proves here what we knew from that she s cute as a button what she doesn t prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress and what s with ed asner as police chief wilson i mean how old is this guy now he s the size of some of the cows mange tried to eat and he seemed out of breath the whole way through i m surprised he made it through the filming there s a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler who also served as executive producer of this anyway i chuckled twice mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan the orangutan has more acting talent so for two chuckles 
i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie don t waste your time or money on this one 
i didn t really like this movie that much at all it wasn t really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that s about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i m not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie final query theaters so glad i didn t squander too much money on this dvd purchase ummm let me think no rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not 
marvin rob schneider does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream but his luck changes when he has a car crush a very bad one and is found by a doctor the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him after this moment he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be by the time he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side in the mean time he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised i am not a big fun of rob schneider in fact this is the his first film i have seen however i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser see his part in ally mcbeal quite funny actually there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat in such movies the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than 
ain t it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it it s such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneider s line of thinking when he made semi successful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal since i ve already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who s suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead colleen haskell from survivor and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry nothing memorably good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it there s a word for that milking actually here s another word cheap 
i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles zvezda barely does the first zvezda being a russian war film i was expecting patriotism sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score slavic cheekbones and cruel germans what i didn t need was the naive love non affair the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references stalinism nazism holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about liberating poland a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently 
for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie for outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction how a young woman could love the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense how she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh several hundred german troops advanced pushing the russians into the marsh so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but i am sure an officer would have ordered or men into the water to search the marsh but that would have ended the story also the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end i wonder why you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart tugging in that 
i m a fan of columbo especially on a rainy saturday and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit but this episode was very lacking the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and modern electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale the high tech home is a jetson s or disney version of tomorrowland and fun to think of writers inventing those way out gizmos if its sunny outside go play as there are much better columbo episodes still we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast 
manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and more direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay amitabh does his part with style nothing different from coolie laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual
bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan s mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag parvarish amar akbar anthony naseeb desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part maybe mr desai ran out of ideas after all he had been using that formula for years and years first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa for instance the police inspector who brings up amar the muslim who brings up akbar nirupa roy and a few more in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight in mard she loses her voice in aaa there is the famous song shirdi wale sai baba well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali having seen aaa for over times i noticed that straight away my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn t like it one bit it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child 
dreary schlocky just plain dreadful and awful let s be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d avenger you aren t expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts you don t get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super human abilities giver returns and fights dressed as the double d avenger a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack zip drive motivation and are tissue thin the acting isn t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy handed boob references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former selves instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun 
this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen i have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just wasn t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt if you re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert the action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that s certainly a pro for this particular movie 
i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the sci fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find as such i m sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion the acting was uncharacteristically sub par as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci fi usually has in store for us there are a few cameos made by people you d most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart the cgi special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci fi feature is lacking sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he s known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointment if i was rating it on a star scale made specifically to judge made for tv movies i d probably give it a maybe even a a real shame that i may have to wait till the next sci fi original movie to get a good laugh and i really hope that this movie isn t part of some overall quality increase in sci fi original movies 
worse than the rating it has been given this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end this movie is terrible in the beginning scenes this movie has moses which was charlton heston in the demille film pharoah yul brynner and nefretiri anne baxtor overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality 
tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the s during the filming of demille s first version of the commandments and which is reawakened when demille s sets are unearthed in the desert one of the worst films i ve seen in a long time the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons you will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies 
watching the first minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy the setup was promising in the s cecil b demille makes his opus of the ten commandments it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don t they always aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site the movie s first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci fi channel movie the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it s a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect then the body counts starts this is were the movie went south for me the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do they make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk really i m not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i d put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it s standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades for a sci fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn t saying much at all what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it 
i m at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this poppycock of a movie they had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story there is the buried set some wolf headed monster running amok an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is what i would have missed had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase some really bad c g i some incredibly stupid dialog more bad c g i and the hero fighting paper cut outs other than the original idea this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities my mistake for continuing to watch merk
while the idea is more original than most sci fi movies the execution is as usual lacking while the practical mummy effects are not bad and the gun nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen i suspect that was the idea all along they do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first minutes or so when morena s character sported some tomb raider style shorts not high brow cinema i know but you can t deny true beauty when you see it and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere 
reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblay s supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it s audience i didn t hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it s page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn t seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper l odyss e d alice tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you 
just saw this movie and what a waste of time the movie was predictable and slow it s basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball rather than watching this movie i should have had a root canal the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship funding this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball however because it s rated pg the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard thurl bailey s appearance in the film was completely unnecessary 
this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet it made the rm sons of provo look like well done films it was supposed to be funny from what i was told the best part was the best actor in the movie travis eberhard if he wasn t in the movie it probably wouldn t have been made he ruled it wasn t funny it was beat it had thurl big t bailey who s character made no sense it was made in provo it didn t make fun of brokeback it had larry h miller in it it was the st movie clint howard wasn t funny in gary coleman chose the perfect movie a comeback they should have cast at surreal life auditions it was made by halestorm entertainment 
well i suppose the good news concerning william winckler s opus the double d avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer s mammarian marvels kitten natividad haji and raven de la croix in one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and there s plenty of it is that this film if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video is a complete misfire a total abortion an out and out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l a too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papier mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth saggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie stars instead of to be succinct joe bob briggs his voice over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around synonyms for the word breast from the on his web site s canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status 
this movie is a total dog i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn t feel like i d totally wasted my money and my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible it s a shame it s not up to the standards of other hale storm movies they should have saved the money on getting d list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman wasn t properly utilized for his role this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was including the subplots after viewing this movie i m left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite like humor where it s not so much the lines as the character and the delivery unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead 
i went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn t even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids ages and and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn t save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie i use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing 
the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget halestorm entertainment has had to work with all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing i think just because i couldn t believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film 
trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you ve heard about semi devout mormons and you ll see they ve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt hale s fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didn t understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painful the only reason i didn t give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won t let me 
first of all let me say the i am lds or rather i am a mormon so when i watched this film i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch and this one was no exception it does have its redeeming moments but they are few and far between one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church in the lds church congregations are called wards and the basketball court is in the cultural hall never once are either of these two names mentioned the church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes this film had so much potential it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired if i were not already lds i d be left thinking mormons are stupid idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends sorry halestorm you can do better than this 
i ve never been a huge fan of mormon films being a mormon i ve always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non mormon friends boy was i wrong i figured since this had b list talent like clint howard gary coleman andrew wilson and fred willard one of my favorites this would have to be at least a little funny and besides church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such but i must say throughout the entire movie it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored the dialogue was bland and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen every single character but wilson s was less than one dimensional it s hard to believe that after nine re writes the film was still as mind numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed i can t put into words the rage i felt sitting through this my friends and i were extras in the final game scene so we went to the premiere in washington city ut kurt hale the director was there and i must say i avoided all contact with him after the show he waited at the door seemingly ready for feedback i couldn t bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life but it left a nasty painful scar that i will never forget here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame uninteresting characters there were many subplots that popped up every now and then each promising the audience the chance for laughs but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ending before you could even start caring this was pretty much how the whole movie felt this film was a major letdown and i feel bad for everyone who s expecting the first real funny mormon movie true the jokes in this one aren t too exclusive to mormons then again it s hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears please do not see this movie keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious spare yourself the disappointment i went through
i wanted to like this film i really did it s got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat it tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over zealous cooking attempts over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someone s yard so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that while mildly interesting are really just filler all the work scene s and i didn t find the villians intimidating or worth hating so much as i found them to be childishly annoying i ve met people like those in the film while playing church ball and i will say the referee s are spot on still in the end i really didn t care all that much about the characters or their quest for church ball glory maybe because they were all so one dimensional which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall kurt hale and halestorm entertainment has made some good films but this is not one of them 
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong 
i was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen i thought it was supposed to be a comedy but i only snickered at or jokes is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over what was up with the janitor in heaven scene fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations but this did not work they must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie 
this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor this nail trap catches these bad guys the rest of the movie degrades as you go i can t believe that this movie is not even in the bottom movies of all time i also can t believe that there are sequels the next crap movie that i want to watch is r o t o r could r o t o r really be much worse than this 
kitten natividad of russ meyer film fame plays chastity knott a woman who has found she has breast cancer so she goes to south america to get some special fruit crockazilla that is supposed to have healing powers after going down on some of this fruit which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super hero specifically the double d avenger note that she s also wearing a pair of panties as a mask in writing that all sounds pretty good in execution well it leaves more than a little to be desired it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she s taking away their business so some of the strippers including haji also of russ meyer film fame go after her to ruin her of course chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger watch her do a wonder woman type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted s live action kid s show with adult content although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg at the worst and it s probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered this makes doris wishman s chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison special appearance by forest j ackerman but so what very stupid and i m never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover out of 
first let s all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of ^ called snakeeater the film industry as a whole sank first let s start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through guys feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin with now the acting being an actor myself i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the jackasses playing the clampets deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big break finally the action the gunfighting is so so at best and the fist fighting is deplorable i ve seen more real looking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fake looking readers listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your brain cell count do not watch this thing 
wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie stars but is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is more snake eater movies guess its in demand 
lorenzo lamas stars as jack `solider` kelly an ex vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has minutes of screen time and even those aren t any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel 
this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though all the characters are just annoying except lamas and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for plus the action is very boring the film gives us villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up plus it looks very cheap and amateurish lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he can t save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button plus the dialog is especially laughable there is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart plus the scene where the villains torture jennifer s family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though however it is not enough not recommended the direction is very bad george erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace the acting is pretty bad except for lamas lorenzo lamas is awesome here and while he isn t required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he can t save this one and he had no chemistry with the cast either lamas rules josie bell is terrible here and while she s decent looking she isn t very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas cheryl jeans is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at that robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain and wasn t menacing at all he was laughable as were the other rest of the cast are bad overall avoid avoid even if you do like lamas like me out of 
now i ve seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies i ve seen and enjoyed all of jean claude van damme s movies including the one where he s his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where he s a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians hey if nothing else he s got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in that s why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan look like citizen kane everything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earth time bendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast including lorenzo lamas and that s really saying something and i d be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially lorenzo lamas it does manage to be unintentionally funny so it s not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry it didn t help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron palillo s cameo as a gay arsonist 
words can t simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically snakeeater is about an ex military man lorenzo lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance style rednecks the film s acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time however there is one treat horshack ron pallio from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs 
 that malcom show on fox is really making a killing can t we do our own version i speculate and paraphrase of course but in our hearts we all know it s true and that the only thing nbc added to the malcom metric was sex and boy did they add sex thirteen year old tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window and this is all in the pilot take it from a grown man a boy s puberty is so sex crazy and testicle driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies and you can count those on one hand so it s no surprise that tucker has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty isn t this the stuff people go to jail for if you doubt the show s depravity consider this episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only episodes aired they then made the unprecedented move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them ironic since kids were originally the target audience apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voice over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing even in it was horribly dated with it s ska incidental music and super sarcasm i couldn t like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn t exactly come a mile a minute shame on nbc for this dirty rip off they re better than that grade c 
first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay i don t think this movie has any purpose it s boring from the first minute to the last i don t understand why this movie scores so high i gave it but actually it s not more wurth then 
what were they thinking at cannes one of the most irritating films of all time every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running but no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over the whole thing was filled with un likeable and unsympathetic characters they deserved the misery that was rosetta and to think i passed up tumbleweeds to see this over hyped film of boredom it was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting 
i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this woman s life it is one paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they don t and i don t think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film 
hard to describe this one if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot though forry ackerman has not fared so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie it was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e brown comedy or abbott and costello if that s your thing basically just bad puns still i found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than reasons good job but still a fundamentally flimsy production 
if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up it s just boring pretentious twaddle the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme overseas it ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy it s called dogme because that s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera 
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d or at the cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn t believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can t even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at o clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible 
i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input i know they re going for realism but to be frank i just don t want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life i ll uhm live tell me an interesting story and we ll talk i can deal with the low production values hell i m a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously i m supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walking to someplace rosetta working in a bakery rosetta eating a waffle rosetta carrying around bags of far rosetta walking back home rosetta walking someplace it s just not that entertaining there isn t really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it s just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess i m supposed to love this but come on there s nothing in there 
this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made 
if there was a stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don t know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a challenge don t make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games make them do an actual challenge and as for earning prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that ain t gonna happen 
this is the story of two guys who found a copy of funky monkey finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon after seeing such classics as every which way but loose and project x these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required it was apparent that the monkey wasn t trained in the school of shakespearean acting perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look a like matthew modine while some might argue that matthew modine doesn t come close to jet li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can t handle the movie the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie even matthew modine should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line i m second fiddle to a monkey doesn t seem to work with the ladies shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them seven days 
i bought this movie from gamestop s discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesn t help that he wasn t even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn t even known for producing a poop chute film why was this movie ever made 
i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a cyber kung fu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering is this the film that s going to break the mold let s face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar after such great classics as monkey trouble and dunston checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i contemplated suicide now i ve read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesn t explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didn t let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z i t has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesn t seem cost effective well anyways z i t brings in a cia specialist matthew modine to train clemens the chimp clemens is everything z i t hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we re watching a kid s movie as you may have guessed modine finds out that z i t s intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break clemens out being a cia agent and all modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything z i t finds out where modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and hooch it doesn t matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win yay hooray for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game funky monkey never lets up it s edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkey filled features after finishing this epic i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe funky monkey is a metal rod among movies 
having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas i came here to pan it but after reading the other comments i haven t the heart clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age well let me not be a complete grinch it might still work for some children if they are not too media saturated and have not become visually over sophisticated e g from watching all of lotr and harry potter but if you are an adult stay miles away you will not enjoy it the good bits barbara kellerman as the witch especially in her early scenes with edmund creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness at the stone table she goes a bit over the top michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s perry as mr tumnus also have the kind of polished skillful acting we d expect from the very best bbc dramas and the aslan costume works very well amazingly well considering they got the eyes just right the bad bits almost everything else but two areas in particular one the casting england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well peter has no gravitas or charisma and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings edmund is just whiny and lucy sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically visibly drastically wrong for this part that i can t imagine how she got the job two the animal costumes again it appears that they worked for some kids if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting believable characters they might be entranced by this film but to a viewer with the sophistication of say a year old who s seen prisoner of azkaban when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree there will be hoots of cruel derisive laughter the costumes just do not work i could not and i think any adult or modern teen could not suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver the drawn animation later gryphons etc works better is easier to take so ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read or re read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination 
i m a fan of the series and have read all books i wanted to see this just to see how it was done all i can say is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it its pretty bad and will turn you off reading them not to be mean but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie was she the directors daughter seriously i m sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame the movie just loses so much in translation cs books don t translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books or even harry potter one thing they did right aslan very well done although the other human actors with painted faces beavers wolf look silly aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around i guess its like that old horse custume people inside also i would be curious what kids think of this movie maybe they would enjoy it but as for adults safe bet they wont even if a cs fan 
i watched this a few days ago so details are getting hazy the film is shot on hand held cameras and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally since we hadn t had many studio pictures made in this way i can t help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn t had all the compromises that come with a big budget and so was more real however what we have here isn t much more than a not as good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyone who has seen that or any one of the other rip offs there of will know what to expect the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters with the weedy soft kids out of their depth close harmony singing ebonics spouting black dudes world weary sergeants bitter and twisted psychos etc etc all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation maybe it was laziness or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience all i know is it was annoying one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it this seems to be the main pivot of the plot with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way the other big bug i had was how all the characters with the exception of the psychos and the real softies would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence faced with farrell s ubiquitous stoicism immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads which was strong and very convincing tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters this wasn t too hard in my imagination bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty and for my money episodes of that would be more fun to watch 
ouch they don t come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c s lewis s beloved novel while the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play i ve read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the that it looks like this was filmed for the worst effect of all is mr beaver i know computer effects weren t at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all costs 
though the movie may have been true to lewis s book in that the script was basically word for word verbatim it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this the mythical creatures unicorns centaurs griffins ghouls ghosts are drawn in and as in the previous review the green screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth i nearly cried when i heard the wolf s howl a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could all of the acting is tremendously forced especially that of little lucy penvensie i could only take so much indignation desperation and buck teeth in the what felt like fourteen hours of watching the movie the actress who plays the white witch in all her histrionics seems that she d be more at home on stage where a booming voice spread arms and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome the sets feel claustrophobic whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors indoors it s as if bbc could only afford to spend on constructing a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly huddled together the white witch s castle is a run down rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods actually any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film s entire budget on building the mechanical feline it looks great when it s standing still and before it starts speaking but once it starts moving you can t help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear end in the lion suit yes if you are a hardcore narnia fan you may want to see this version simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote but lewis was certainly no screenwriter and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen during the scene in which the children are at the beavers and getting ready to flee from the wolves mrs beaver s incessant oh just one more thing dearies and then we will be ready to go punctuated by the children s simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of no mrs beaver please a scene of comic relief so incongruous they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have in fact the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these i would recommend seeing the new narnia disney the new movie with updated effects spectacular computer animation great timing all around and a gorgeous and scene stealing white witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a shrieking banshee captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis s original vision i think lucy is a lot cuter no buck teeth yay as are the beavers and realistically sized and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine desperately hungry for acceptance insecure and angsting with an inferiority complex edmund that the new disney version fronts unless you re the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies i would not recommend this film to anyone 
this movie is terrible but it has some good effects 
i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment once i realized i would not be getting that i watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming and yeah that was it but aside from it having a good film quality considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long there was nothing good about that movie he killed why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully serisouly who can answer that for me who can answer anything awful about this movie for me i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff that s all it seemed to be poor mr carroll i m so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales 
i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carroll s alice books i was very excited about this movie s premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i m enthusiastic about modern re tellings if they are treated well usually it s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the original s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didn t help that the actors weren t very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman s work also i d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance off was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the film what a joke don t see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry 
i m actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it but i thought am still thinking as i m presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again very it looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didn t pay that much attention to detail i don t want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just don t get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe it s me that s the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding sheesh 
a friend once told me that an art house independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats of course my imagination ran amok trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work well now my imagination can be put to rest i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky s films are slow moving and inert opinions being what they are i found this not to be true of the late director s wonderful works which are wrought with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky i was excited to experience his films with the exception of the open air ride through the fields stalker this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level it s supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft there is a no balance no proportion and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow the main character is so inept and indecisive it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner i am also not adverse to non plots or story lines that progress on multiple non linear fashion but there isn t even a non story here one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hair pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short i won t rule out that this may be one of sokurov s stinkers tarkovsky s solaris but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky s heir based on this film would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle c mon guys don t be afraid to say it no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life i don t profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don t have russian values but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky s work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewers if it didn t have sokurov s name on it and it aired on say saturday night live i m pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick 
believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like low budget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesn t work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian way i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where ended to bad they didn t try that instead i just don t understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldn t be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but more likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor 
 this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so patently obvious oh my god where do i start well here this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my civic duty such is the badness of this flick begin digression but let me just state one thing before i start i m not some harvard art major film noir weenie in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass ave in cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerd who would obsessively love comic book films census group and still i hated this film my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards bond flicks clerks and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldn t have been subjected to that dung heap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few s here on imdb for god s sake so i m as shallow as they come therefore i m not criticizing this film because i m looking for some standard of cinematic excellence it s because elektra stinks like a three week old dead goat end digression ok there s so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it here goes ms garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding nemo the latter was the sexier film you know the red outfit she s advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice once at the beginning once at the end bummer in the rest she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female lots of pouting and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying oh my god you d think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um wait the bad guys gal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you d expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit at least next to jgar s performance it doesn t stand out too badly one guy s role is to stand there and be huge another s is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman s role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people they manage to pull these incredible feats off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guy gal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense plot twists this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention let s just put it this way my wife who has only been in the u s for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg s pad and i swear to god i am not making this up she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isn t stupid but she isn t being courted by mensa for her gifts either and she s had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre and she figured this out in seconds with no prodding and no prior information such is the blatant obviousness of this film rarely before seen stupidity ok so there s this big dude in the film he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it s lint and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it or something more defenses kicking in thank god but jg jumps on his head and he explodes an achilles noggin ok such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film ack i m starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if armageddon is going to come please let it be before this comes out on dvd 
perhaps i m out of date or just don t know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn t particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller s book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she s the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn t care either way 
while some scenes of training were realistic too many of them depicted military instructors as ex nazi types obviously the people who wrote the screen play were either anti military types or writing a film for that audience i am a viet nam vet and even during this period military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison and i really loved the scene where the hero and his buddy both privates are sitting down in the captain s office smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation as was the purpose for the scene at the end i asked myself what was this film about as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except i hate all authority thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it 
this is absurd aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick i can t help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra considering how generous they were with their praise admittedly i m not really a fan of comic book to movie conversions so i didn t go in with many expectations yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil which i have no intention of seeing furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline and don t even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot i m also still scratching my head over the fate of cary hiroyuki tagawa s character which seems to have gone by unexplained if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra i know we re supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated me well hell at least jennifer garner looks damn good 
how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character quirks the brown sauce romanticising all that is bad about dublin the attitude of ah it s a dump but sure isnt it great all the same plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney s character a great actor forced to play this part that could ve been written by a five year old cringeworthy stuff the best thing about this movie is farrell and it s a bad when you have to say that well at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock you ll have a better time intermission is a walk outer
this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life affirming film but it s more of a camera jerky mess it s a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldn t care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasn t any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong 
if you loved pulp fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film i liked the quirky story even though i feel that pulp fiction was the most over rated movie since the english patient and found the characters unrealistic but interesting it s not on the waterfront or citizen kane and is burdened by european pretentiousness but the worst part by far is the hand held camera it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end i don t know why new directors think this method of filming is so great if you are prone to motion sickness stay away the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about minutes 
i m irish and i ve been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission and i will go on record as saying this film is awful it is not quite as bad a something like the most fertile man in ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments i went down or michael collins some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as colm meaneys american style garda but the film itself is shot completely wrong the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama but it isn t this is an irish lock stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just looks sloppy and thrown together the performances are okay given the awful script a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag but it no way compares to his performances in minority report tigerland or phone booth the best performance was from dierdre o kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman i think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting all in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever i m expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great but before you reply ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america 
this movie blows let s get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he s ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let s face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall don t bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success 
a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some dependence on something this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirely there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance then we have losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film 
i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn t been this is one god awful flick i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is indie films blow well this film does nothing to shed this curse the actor writer director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re hashes tired clich s from movies past i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it s way too overdone i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back not that this concept bugs me but i didn t really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it s inconceivable my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her the last point that i have is and i won t hold this against kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting lord help us all 
usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn t have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case here bonesetter is a perfect example of a film it does nothing right and it doesn t have the chance to because it doesn t really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn t hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more a truly awful film 
words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is i wish it were so bad it s good but it s not it s just dull lifeless and boring it s so bad i couldn t even laugh at it in response to other posters anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead they both look like inbreeds sister and brother the gal sherry thurig is a looker the complete opposite of anne marie attractive this girl is tall and willowy and can act although you can tell she s holding back all the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male mark i ve seen less wood in a rain forest but he s still better than kelly why would kelly keep his actors from acting is he really that bad a director everyone else has summed the story up perfectly there isn t one kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime i know how he felt stepping in the poo it s how i felt after watching his movie yes i tried to get my money back from the rental store this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out you ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks 
i realise that the us army was demoralised by but this film was unbelievable it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel the writer must be a real army hater the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well these men were going overseas the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from and an investigation would have ensued the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one farrell the alleged barrack room lawyer would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention actual assault on an enlisted man sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer intead he just walks away after this discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable i don t know how it ended i went to bed 
a truly frightening film feels as if it were made in the early s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream aspiring people retrograde to the point of being offensive ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex crazed gays wow who knew the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the effeminate buffoon the bitter lonely queen the fag hag etc and the main characters are milquetoast middle class middlebrow clones of little interest as far as the romantic ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned there s not much to say we ve seen it all before and done much better 
or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore honestly this isn t the worst gay movie i ve seen that would be regarding billy but it s down there very close to the bottom of the barrel this thing drags and drags and drags it s not that the plot is inane in the hands of a good writer it might have worked it certainly could have been much more entertaining there s not one plot point you can t see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury it s full of one dimensional stereotypical gays nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other we re just told they re in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren t compatible sexually they like the same book huh the acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost jarmusch slow but without jarmusch quality in fact that would be a good barometer for you if you like jarmusch films avoid this one 
movie had some good acting and good moments though obviously pretty low budget but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn t play out in a realistic manner at all there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money also several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is apologizing to adam for his past while adam is shown to be upstanding and traditional which the film proclaims to be the good way in the end i don t like being preached to like that i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in glenn s shoes and he said he does in real life relate to glenn s view that he could never date someone with adam s views well then i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film also director said he directed this his first movie only after reading directing for dummies directing was not that bad but far from a top notch effort i ve seen worse but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated 
when this play was first shown by the bbc over years ago it would have been something quite different for the time so therefor some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effects looking at the play in this day and age it doesn t seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel i don t think so but if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the red light maybe that s how it was in dickens time you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting i can t help but notice things like that i will not take anything away from the acting both denholm elliott signalman and bernard lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performances i am not at all sure what is going on i mean was the ghost the traveller or what does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that don t to sum up the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character it suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual signalling practises thanks for reading my review 
i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it s about somebody got murdered or maybe they didn t and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn t this brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time i ve never found margaret atwood s books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isn t easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious 
i don t know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book i ve always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn t perfect but this movie was the worst ever the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie this really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written the actors for roz tony charis and zenia were well chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary louise parker i only wish they d had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all 
when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of the book i assumed she d be playing tony roz or charis but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn t read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz tony and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with in the film these women aren t people they are characters in the book zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia which was so wrong zenia is a catherine zeta jones angelina jolie or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type she is a woman men can t not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way and once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment she s the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she s always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don t know her game in the film zenia didn t take charis s man the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed it s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movie confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all and roz s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture which was weird since zenia took roz s business and home life in the book which is why roz hated her so much and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz s husband years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even at the party where zenia and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it tony s character was so wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book the film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn t necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of researching this meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous which of course zenia bails on to hide zenia s body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they conspired together to do it and then zenia also managed to take all of roz s money in the process by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been if you aren t confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused it was terrible i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of 
i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood s novel the robber bride and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an ex cop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman s crazy female friends it s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms atwood s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women heh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and i m pretty sure they re entirely made up for the movie i ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren t enough to carry the movie zenia s manipulations aren t interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man s life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to a man because it s not important if a man doesn t hear them i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man s story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadn t read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you re out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot it s the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst it s like zenia s revenge on margaret atwood 
if i had never read the book i would have said it was a good movie but i did read the book who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline there is so many changes that it wasn t really worthy of the title character changes plot changes time line changes first off who was henry and the investigator they weren t in the story henry had mitch s persona somewhat but mitch wasn t a cop no you made it so roz helped sink his body and used that as zenia s blackmail against roz the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother her son wasn t even really mentioned in the story neither i don t believe was his lover roz s secretary tony and west were not together in the beginning he was actually with zenia first while in college the black painted apartment was their idea tony just went to visit this is where zenia and tony meet become fast friends tony hides her love for west then zenia left west with cash from tony then west and tony get together eventually marry at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time only to be heart broken again then go back to tony zenia s blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia now being a professor at college she didn t want to let it get out i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully charis character was a blond not that it really matters zenia didn t trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive no she was there when charis had a lover named billy augusta s father he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal zenia and billy have an affair right under charis s nose while taking care of them both then zenia turns in billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him not with augusta charis was pregnant with her tho charis also had a split personality karen was her real name zenia did not die from being cut up into piece s she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od d she was also really dieing of cancer this time around it didn t show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader the book was striped down to its bare bones then re made in someone else s vision why couldn t you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie it was different enough and i m sure could have been made more so 
 warning no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast wow very very wrong this movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film years after it was shot the copyright date on the box said yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late s early s dresses and hairdos it looked as if it had been shot a good or years before the rest of the film i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more s than s or even st century trying to be s then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet it s a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included it was all the flashback sequences shot in as a complete student film of the same title as this movie it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the co worker in the scenes thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time the shell story shot in is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead something about a promise made by the dying man in the early s to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clich d action that permeates the new movie don t bother there s a reason why you ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast it s terrible 
i got this movie in the bin at walmart i would not recommend watching this move i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for hours i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie it s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam okay here is my rant about this movie to me this movie is slow and hard to watch it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end it doesn t after the movie was over i through it behind my t v because i was angry that i wasted almost hours of my life watching it and another minutes writing this review to warn people about it 
i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john gielguld vittorio de sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce but maybe in people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine meanwhile the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in thought the chinese looked like comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all don t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice so when the pope gets crowned in rome he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie i d give it three oscars for stupidity by the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope he is much more plausible as zorba the greek 
my brother is an avid dvd collector he took one look at the cover two models on toilets and had to add it to his collection i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie i use that term loosely i ve felt obligated to sit through i dared not make eye contact with my brother quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene which the filmmaker decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie in fact the whole movie pretty much follows this suit the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock i went to bed without viewing it however to no surprise at all i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later 
the underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train wrecks i ve ever seen luckily i didn t pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was i love off color comedy i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found maybe there wasn t supposed to be a plot so i can t hold that against this movie it s pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat by batman a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat hilarious simply genius i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn t understand or perhaps it s the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean p s don t buy this movie 
sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn t even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn t get through minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit 
sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one you can only stand about minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension why he lent his name to this vermin 
anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie i first saw ads for this movie back in it looked like it could be funny but i wasn t about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster about a year and a half later i was at tower records and in the dvds for less than pile there was a copy of this movie seeing that the dvd was only i decided to buy it i got home put the disc in the dvd player and waited for the laughs to start and i waited some more the laughs never came i d have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time no stars 
the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i ve ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic bat man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit they just aren t funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer s ineptness at comedy keep the underground comedy movie underground bury it 
first of all what the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn t watch what the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked off a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth but from what i hear its not even offensive so they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage and they cant even pull that off 
this movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film if you can call it that 
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times worse got that ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i ve ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny the only reason i m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s not surprise why 
i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberal s fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell s character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers i kept thinking hey there s a reason why boot camp is tough it s supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit there s no room for cocky attitudes and men who won t follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people s feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit 
i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i m working oh i m sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don t think more than was spent making it total crap who let s this stuff be released 
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money 
words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated nc shunning away the only people that might tolerate it 
i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru not one laugh in it ok maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big black bald gay virgin but the rest of it was shockingly un funny on top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever steer clear of this one if you value your time and money dreadful the worst 
hawked as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked i m offended that we shelled out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i ve seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked there is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best color me p ed thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny that s saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie it s many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably crash and burn 
how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks 
it really impresses me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didn t appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you d have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn t it 
this movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact using absurdity and obscenity the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie my god it hurts in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great but it failed at least the director made something out of nothing but it isn t something good many movies didn t turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all it s the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making no to correct myself it s even worse than that a movie with gags so bad that they aren t funny at all it s not even fun to watch the lead actor writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies the movie is too bad for that 
this film stars among others slapchop vince offer who also wrote edited and directed and joey buttafuoco not exactly names that scream out quality and with such uplifting skits as supermodels taking a dump it s exactly what it sounds like a guy who robs a sperm bank the rhymer necrophilia with a rotting corpse black market fetuses featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar lots and lots of gay jokes a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions the skits are painfully unfunny such as batman and rhymer the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude and stupid i truly believe a group of year olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by slap shot vince against the scientologists frankly i wouldn t know who to root for in this case apparently he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and unfunny by comparison ebola is funnier and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie by the way that is bobby lee from mad tv wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film it s amazing his career could overcome this 
lately they have been trying to hock this film late night on cable tv commercials don t believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the rd worst movie of all time just behind mac me worst and jack frost worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so don t waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy i m not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you don t believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs enthusiastically down 
i bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over dvd s with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin 
i rated this movie as awful after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offend everyone the trailer said well it did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and what s with all the gays in this movie i m not gay and i don t have a problem with those who are but what s the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like that so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you ve already seen a million times you ll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy s it really is total crap 
since most review s of this film are of screening s seen decade s ago i d like to add a more recent one the film open s with stock footage of b s bombing germany the film cut s to oskar werner s hauptmann captain wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler s fuehrer bunker once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cut s to one of many conference scene s with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer s to ultimate victory while werner s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen s are caught up in a fantasy world some non bunker event s are depicted most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit s and his family s difficulty in surviving this film suffer s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only year s after ww should not have included the actor portraying goebbels willy krause wear s the same uniform as hitler including arm eagle goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband the ss soldier s wear german army camouflage the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy s of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker it was done outside in the courtyard and lastly hitler s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model most account s agree it was a walther ppk some bit s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a cabaret skit with a intoxicated wounded soldier his arm in a splint maniacally goose stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease belly dance all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watch the most incredible bit is when werner s captain wust gain s an audience alone with skoda s hitler hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench drugged and delirious when werner s character begin s to question him hitler start s screaming which bring s in a ss guard who mortally wound s werner s character in the back with a gunshot this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account werner s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare s his own ending hitler s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off screen the final second s of the movie show hitler s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner hauptmann wust this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film s such as the remake hitler the last day s or the german film downfall der untergang if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story these last two film s are based on first person eyewitness account s with hitler the last day s being compiled from gerhard boldt s autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and downfall being done from hitler s secretary s recollection s the screen play for der letzte akte is taken from american nuremberg war crime s trial judge michael musmanno s book ten day s to die which is more a compilation of event s many obviously fanciful than eyewitness history it is surprising that hugh trevor roper s account the last day s of hitler was never made into a film 
this movie doesn t even deserve a one this was an utter waste of time it was a waste of film and money it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language but not only that there is no plot line the actors are terrible the accents are horrible the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt who got only a fifteen second part by the way i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times adding only a new sentence a film similar to this is eraser head possibly the most disturbing movie in existence there is no plot line and is not funny although it isn t trying to be funny do not watch either movie 
a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day not as mind numbingly awful as say freddy got fingered or lost reality but that in no way is an endorsement in any way sense or form features the worst rhyming clown ever any most if it isn t offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct it also has the worst song parody ever put on film the worst arnold impersonation ever not just the worst put on film literally the worst ever i have no clue why karen black micheal clarke duncan or slash would star in this the reasons i watched this in the first place the only thing mildly amusing was dickman in conclusion i would t recommend this film to anyone but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom on this site are pathetic do something notable with you lives people plus if it s true the church of scientalogy hates him he can t be all bad my grade d
and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy and only percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on i ve seen pauly shore movies that are times funnier than the underground comedy movie here s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d kman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen that s it that s the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch there s a bag lady beauty contest in which we re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches might ve sounded funny on paper but anybody who s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won t be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who s saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they re regarded as stuck up squares i just saw white chicks recently that s another low brow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it s not funny what the writers and directors don t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn t work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from there s something about mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list the joke about the semen wasn t just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn t go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and that s when it s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben s ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy thing s not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer cause you weren t cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let s face it nowadays it s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjective but this movie shouldn t be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan s fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there can t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i don t think she s done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the film s biggest star keeping in mind duncan wasn t famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven t heard of her for good reason usually i m in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesn t become a cult classic shouldn t there be a law against distributing crap like this 
i m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it s funny you can say or do anything but if it s not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero 
this is the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices i ve made in film rentals i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender the skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags and it s such a blatant and poor rip off of the kentucky fried movie that you ll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer whoever that is unless you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish 
i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago and said to myself seems funny plus it has michael clarke duncan how can i lose i proceeded to pay plus tax for it i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted wooden performances abound all the hilarious and outstanding performances promised never seemed to arrive after minutes i hung my head in shame knowing that i could never get that minutes or back i literally almost cried as well because if that was what could be considered comedy i didn t want to believe in movies anymore my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn t want to watch it alone this was my next horrible mistake because as i watched i just became angry i began to yell at the movie and i m not one to talk to movies period everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they ve ever seen my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends but that could not save this movie even the fact that this movie is not on the bottom list on imdb is astounding the fact that its rating at the time of this writing is is a crime against humanity 
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times worse got that ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i ve ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny the only reason i m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s no surprise why 
a woman s nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement of course b horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard and the last twenty minutes of brinke s bloody rampage are quite fun to watch the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful better watch scalps or alien dead again of course i ain t expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray but haunting fear is too dull to be enjoyable 
i purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle b grade i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp ie surf nazis must die is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer 
fred olen ray is a lousy director even as far as b movie directors go but haunting fear is probably one of his better films yes it does butcher the great poe story premature burial and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband jay richardson is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster played by robert quarry delia sheppard a veteran of many early s soft core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes the ending didn t make much sense 
this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny there s almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill ted franchise the joke was over the grim reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement there s a zz top impression hammered in for no reason there s lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funny skip this bogus thing 
first off with names like fred olen ray brinke stevens and jan michael vincent plus distributors like rhino and troma on the video box you know what you re getting into with this one b movie mania if you re actually expecting to see a thriller based on edgar allan poe then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman s poe films this is pure unadulterated sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to the premature burial complete with lots of r rated ready for video sex and nudity however it s certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way brinke who has three nude scenes in the first minutes plays rich traumatized insomniac housewife victoria monroe whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father hoke howell her worthless husband terry jay richardson has racked up some serious gambling debt owed to a gangster played by robert quarry and with help from his kinky blonde european accented sexpot secretary lisa delia sheppard plots to do away with brinke for her money name value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist she s way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this s sci fi horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still living vicki jan michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home the kill a spouse for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before the ending is an unintentional laugh riot concluding with a direct rip off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here 
hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward it is something like minutes long but would be better in ten there s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like quasimodo only he is much less sympathetic there s a strange love story involved which doesn t have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother that s what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k short film now it s a portrait of a character who doesn t change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job there s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in women s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head a badger you ve got to see the ending he returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his dad s new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldn t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background i ve got to admit though i m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this mackenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really dug what a wallraff okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anyway photowise it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe hallam foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get it i m not even gonna comment on the clich indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent clich but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine 
in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe i can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who s afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens 
david mackenzie s follow up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho sexual issues with his dead mother it wants to be gritty realistic and mysterious at the same time it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult to meet this end the film tries hard to be youthful its poster has hand drawn letters looking like that of juno its original soundtrack is comprised of fast paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok just a little misguided but strangely the film is anything but youthful like young adam this film s central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case hallam s mother young adam keeps its mystery quiet contemplative and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come hallam foe does the opposite it foregrounds its character s psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend hallam swiftly interrupts asserting his presence in the household here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie the mystery surrounding his mother s drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father s girlfriend the audience can never really trust hallam because besides being creepy we think his obsession has led him close to insanity this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable right when he s found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home at first it appearing to be looking for the police then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs this movie is in no way mysterious yet it is not blunt either it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues but it adds a very self conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite it goes for a soundtrack heavy trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings picks locks and camps out for the sake of voyeurism these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy giddy or pleasant they are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story mackenzie makes you understand hallam yet he fails to build common ground he expects you to enjoy hallam s trials and tribulations without much ideological justification the film hinges on its audience s perspective on voyeurism the kind of person who engages in it obviously most people would be disgusted by it and hallam foe realizes that but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions he goes from person to person trying to fill his deep void there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam s love interest kate where she drunkenly says i love creepy boys perhaps asking the audience to do the same the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him it s not hard to like hallam but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all all the while the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act muddy development and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie recently this film was re named for a us release and for what reason not only is it more unappealing but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title mister 
i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee but then in poland in i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is incredibly unwise men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clich s follow sex drive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven t done anything to her this was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and below the waist innuendos do not waste your time on it this is just bad 
once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing i just recently reviewed baby face nelson now i ve seen dillinger and i ve had it this movie is garbage i don t know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde this movie is far from a classic someone called it brilliant that s an insane thing to say this movie can t get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i ve ever seen i don t know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger first of all he looks nothing like him second of all by the time john dillinger was killed he was when oates made this he was you could even tell that he s older than the real dillinger just by looking at him not only was he too old but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis they show baby face nelson die then homer van meter and finally john dillinger john dillinger was killed before both of them the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson not only do the writers not know when they died but they also don t know how they died baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns homer van meter was cornered by the police in st paul and gunned down with machine guns another member of dillinger s gang harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie pierpont wasn t shot harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i m not going to go into it again here let me also add that richard dreyfuss portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic there s a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming leave me alone baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought maybe dillinger didn t agree with nelson s bank robbing methods but they never fought nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten they keep calling him lester baby face nelson he was never in his life known by that name nelson s real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood john milius doesn t know anything where the hell did john milius get his information i could probably make a better movie than him finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette by the way billie frechette wasn t even there that night but a girl named polly hamilton was melvin purvis yells johnny dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away they didn t even have to shoot him they were so close that powder burns were found on his face it was murder they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger s death i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn t john dillinger but i ll stop here if you would like to know more check it out here see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want but don t waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie 
i just finished reading a book about dillinger this movie was horribly inaccurate it s like they got a list of names and just made everything up his robberies and getaways were well planned down to the second when the time was up they left whether they had all of the money or not they had notes of every road where to turn etc purvis never saw him at the restaurant he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed only photos of him the way his gang members died were fictitious dillinger never robbed a bank by himself like he did in this movie if i had never read the book maybe i could have enjoyed the movie the acting was a bit over the top in places the action was overdone as well on second thought i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn t read the book 
proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn s bonnie and clyde and george roy hill s butch cassidy and the sundance kid truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late s through the mid s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn s and hill s movies who the heroes are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger s life from june to july his death to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers dillinger isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy 
near the beginning after it s been established that outlaw john dillinger warren oates is an egomaniacal rapist another bandit of the s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi second in command melvin purvis ben johnson surveys the situations sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth picks up two loaded caliber automatics and stalks off into the distant house alone bang bang bang purvis emerges alone from the house carrying the female hostage the miscreant dead all in long shot if you re enthralled by stories like red riding hood this should have considerable appeal oh it s as exciting as it is mindless pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically multiple violations of the civic code plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols blood all over as history it stinks few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero partly i would guess because of his name melvin purvis we all remember j edgar hoover who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though the picture was written and directed by john milius he s the guy who had it written into his contract that should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions he should be the designated shooter milius is the guy a compleat gun freak who had teddy roosevelt s rough riders in the spanish american war shouting quotations from henry v saint crispin s day and all that exciting yes and complete garbage i knew i d never take him alive and i didn t try too hard neither that is kill em all and let god sort them out you ll just love it 
anyone who visited drive ins in the s s and s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr
first off i must admit that both films i ve seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points my czech isn t bad but having sat through two of his films i wish i hadn t even tried to learn samotari is too cool way too cool it s about ten different story lines that weave in and out together that s not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague tiny really the main characters are between and they ve got jobs and only one studies the best character is the young balkan girl her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day that s about it the only great character everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film if you like alright music see this film if you want to laugh at others stupidity see this film if you like irony and dry humor see an original jarmusch not an imitation and under no circumstances see ondricek s film septej whisper that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes 
i recently watched this film at the th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films i ve ever had the misfortune to watch don t get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g manos hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep 
it s interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film but the problem is that it s not very good there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn t bother for any of them rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can t expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it it s unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films but alas that is what one must do on its own it s not very good and compared to others it s still not very good but it is not without its good points i liked the plot it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well however in the end the film fails to impress the characters are pretty much non existent and we don t care for any of them any of them might die but it s possible to pinpoint the final survivor from very early on 
 i love new york is another entry by vh mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ebonics speaking craziest contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true it s not as bad as it s previous show flavor of love but it s just as bad it reminds me of a skit from the s show in living color where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on the love connection dating show and he picked robin givens for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in this show reminds me of that the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why bother it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you can t hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mother s next show would be on the wwf any way you slice it it s a train wreck you ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately 
the latest rumor going around is that vh is starting casting calls for i love new york mid so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner i know flavor of love is coming up to it s rd season so now with a flavor of love and a i love new york will there ever be a true winner i ve also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the rd season of i love new york i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york i m just stating the latest rumor 
i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either 
this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief housedress and ostrich trimmed high heeled mules to watch in the afternoon lying on the couch eating bonbons in fact bonbons play a prominent role in the movie the only reason i was able to watch to the end is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves dreamy face in almost every scene in most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality more italian than mexican really the dialog is as stiff as wood unfortunately no bodices are ripped the hero is disgracefully perfect mannered and mild the aristocratic warm blooded old world family cliche is as old as the hills what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican this is a fairy story i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women s day magazine i didn t see his name listed but the art director surely was thomas kinkade who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias this film was literally seen through rose colored glasses if you like dreamy pink and blue sky this film is for you the bonbons looked really good too 
it must be the most corniest tv show on the air this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use jim has got to retire or something please let them go of the air if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim s face in conclusion no more please 
i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman it is great when jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless then when he starts to address the priest in his wife s behalf only to find out that she has become the pee woman great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode i d like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo 
i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right this show is a total crud pie belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepford is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell except except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell america s greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushi s brother in law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good that s like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he s in 
all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish how can that be funny of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but jim s character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner and why it that my guess is that it s because he should now better jim s not a stupid guy he can take care of things and he s got the opportunities to do so but he chooses not to it s a conscious choice he makes when he chooses to not play with his kids not go shopping because he doesn t want to buy lady products and it s a choice he makes when he puts down his relatives the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to if the cheryl character was a real person she would have left him years ago and not stay with the deadbeat for years but alas she s just a catalyst for jim s quirky middle class extreme selfishness 
as a young black latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i didn t although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more honestly i would recommend a film like raising victor over this one any day i just was not too impressed 
you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i ll take a stab at one now episode valentines pay jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing wages she realizes her mistake and the usual oh jim you re so lovely the end another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we re so many now in terms of human beings with tvs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you d get an audience two and a half men on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious 
the show is average it doesn t make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesn t look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let s pretend i m yelling because i shouldn t be too loud on the set she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it s annoying you can t really get her personality because she doesn t really produce emotion and doesn t get upset she has this husband who s doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting 
i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it s banality but it is usual in every way it has the dumb husband his smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic relief it sorely needs it stale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental narcotic s nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify a regular guy just like you and me i live in the southern u s so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism down here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or another seeing him on television is brutal overkill 
this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still don t even get it magical power years later goddess dancing what the f is that about the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure 
shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden the infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didn t seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money 
this movie is absolutely pointless one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange this one may be one of the worst though no story crappy special effects shot in or even worse cropped on dvd just avoid it 
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad everything in the last minutes a cat suited cyborg is introduced which muddles everything malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill i just don t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning i could have done better special effects in my bathtub there s no continuity the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad acting do they have to smoke to be bad the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets make up your mind the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing whay is it called seadly wake it has nothing to do with the movie
there are two reasons why i did not give a to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i ve seen so far everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely 
malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different especially designed for people who like yellow filters on their movies 
if mr cranky had rated this i d be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here but as he hasn t i ll have to give it a go myself the only thing giving this movie a instead of a is that malcolm mcdowall s acting is excellent however not even he can save this film from disaster the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity reminiscent of bad s movies even worse both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was it s not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container slave ship to nigeria this ship s computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb or something the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name i honestly can t find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me malcolm mcdowall in particular i won t hold this against him as he s a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie so unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you re male and you re doctor isn t doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you re really community minded buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster 
this is one of the worst written movies i ve ever had to sit through the story s nothing new but it s a cartoon so who cares as long as it s pretty and fun i m not going to go as deep as the characterisations or i ll be here all day except to say that there aren t any the characters change personality whenever it s convenient to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper thumbs down i d vote to cut their thumbs off narrow in on an object prop cut back to character close up character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand repeat that several times with different objects props make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around crashing into each other generally raining destruction all over and which could kill them all at any moment but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless looking almost pastoral green rock in the distance the whole thing is a long succession of events actions and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly this is the plan of cg cartoons except that it doesn t have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies 
terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks i ve ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and where d they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on mm at the age of i d recommend any film student should watch this flick minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors fault it s really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry malcom you should have sent a stunt double you re too good an actor for such a stink bomb 
a terrible movie containing a bevy of d list canadian actors who seem so self conscious about the fact they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so he really has a bad story and script to work with it s not even camp enough to be funny i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner and even the sub characters like eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa didn t the director see that the creature looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske s orange wisps of magic for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind learn from the mistakes of others don t even waste your time with this one you ll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid 
the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students to learn how not to make a film let s see what did the crew mess up in this flick worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc let s face it if this film had been in ultra high contrast black and white and silent it still would have been awful all scenes are dark lighting people call it black often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect the evil robot was hilarious what was that jazz dancing oh i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something i m sure it struck fear into the hearts of the poor editors and how do you edit so much footage of garbage not possible garbage is garbage no matter how you splice it how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys bottom line is i couldn t stand to watch more than minute segments it was so bad but i did see the whole thing with lotsa breaks just to see if it had any good parts in it at all nope none a perfect example of how not to make a flick a must see for every serious film student 
this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and i am not amused this one is pure serious however with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining watcheable enough because of that 
i find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can t muster the film making prowess to pull it off the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesn t take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror the surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father s paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirrel eating albino part of the movie s charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didn t really expect it to come out this way but it s good enough wrap scene blur hopelessly take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father s voice as she reads his diary while we re still talking about a living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater i generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it s not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyuck s general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and i d file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it s not particularly gory trashy or sleazy 
i just watched this movie in high definition on television i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society s job market is great and my problem isn t with the real person who did these things he was a great man but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching that i found it insulting first of all they didn t cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability sure they were competent actors but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches appearing to have only one leg but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful what they couldn t find an actual amputee anywhere for the film for a second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am figure that out 
i was so disappointed in this movie i don t know much about the true story so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination well somewhere the screenplay failed them it was so scattered is this movie about his childhood his love life his own disability his speaking ability his passion for the disabled i m sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story but this movie wasn t it i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities but because of their personalities other small gripes the heavy handed soundtrack it s the seventies we get it already if he s such a phenomenal public speaker why weren t we treated to more than a snippet here and there and even then mostly in montages 
what about dahmer s childhood the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body what about infinity land the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger what about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father his feelings of neglect when his brother was born what about his fascination with insects and animals how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home what about focusing more on his cannibalism and what about his parent s divorce these are all things that should have been included in the film instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that weren t even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer why didn t the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people he could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet known as rodney in this film my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet s character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer so why couldn t he have spend those forty five minutes on something else if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasn t the scene in which he kills steven hicks his first victim is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life unfortunately the film doesn t explain that it was his first killing or that he didn t kill again for nine years we assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when and why what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued finally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an certificate not a we needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us that doesn t mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone s head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his modus operandi was when actually killing anyone watching this film who doesn t know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people he actually killed seventeen men aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isn t all bad there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters i d like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place 
disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last century s most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight to video back in early dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall s dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i m not kidding when i say that it s one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done it s even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkey zero stars 
 dahmer is an interesting film although i wouldn t use horror or thriller do describe it it s more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and rodney well played by artel kay ru rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer s formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer s belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims the roles are well played but the story is thin 
oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesn t make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multi layered characters or attraction it s just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a movie i suppose only children up to years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again it s far too scary for anyone under years of age that there s probably no one that should watch this movie at all take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn t able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of i ll give it out of and that s exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they d deserve a negative rating and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you 
it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america s most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn t even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about minutes of plot stretched into the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father but that s not nearly enough to save this stinker a out of 
curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didn t rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that it s not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good and with all the flash backs and flash forwards i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy renner s performance wasn t too bad you can catch him in s w a t in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop anyway i would rate this as a it only got a because of renner s so so performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer s crimes avoid this one 
way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasn t close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasn t really morbid or scary or didn t even try to be very disturbing as if you would ve had to try what the hell was this writer director thinking here s one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent s house i think jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of j dahmer 
i do have the `guts to inform you to please stay away from `dahmer the biographical film based on the real life story of the grotesque serial killer `dahmer strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject jeffrey dahmer who murdered over young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation however the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm project this is not an easy film to digest even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas appetizers or even some real life `mr potato skins failure
well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something i wasn t exactly looking for a splatterfest as someone puts it or even blood and guts gore i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn t they were nameless faceless and meaningless just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think what makes a guy be a serial killer as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story of which i know very little people here seem to think that the movie didn t have to cover the events of the dahmer story i e his history what happened when he got caught the aftermath etc but it is important you see i assume if you are american you will know all of this we do not all live in america to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told shown this doesn t mean blood and guts there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore without even touching upon some of what he did i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site the movie felt like a void a moment in time with very little substance i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction very slow pace that never changes strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending this movie is poor i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it a definite out of for the acting 
this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it s ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption where was the character development the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in dahmer s development also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh etc i could go on but to sum up too many lagging points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is dahmer 
prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be worse than freddy got fingered i was wrong to sum dahmer up it s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer s encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all you ll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting it wll be less painful 
i m a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn t sit through this putrid piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn flic soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen 
dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn t explain why i got so bored by this flick its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there s no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer s dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn t since it s based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened it s not easy to tell i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie i didn t like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended 
i really felt cheated after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie minutes for nothing i don t understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos it ends suddenly and you know there s going to be another episode next week it also felt like i just watched part to a two part movie there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didn t know the rest of the story they wanted to make a dahmer after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods all of a sudden i hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail how about showing how he got there how about showing dahmer s trial how about showing some more detail i can t even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place i actually found myself saying in disbelief that s it that s the end i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made to the filmmakers i d like to say if you re going to do it do it right 
don t waste your time on this dreck as portrayed the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture gothic was entertainment at least this is crap if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other this may be right up your alley lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect what a waste of time see gothic instead i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter but didn t catch the title i was hoping this was it but no such luck not recommended 
this was a truly bad film the character cole played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil it didn t after about minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance this would have added some sincerity badly acted unsympathetic characters razor thin plot line yuck 
the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing 
saw in on tv late last night yeah i can hear what y all say about this one it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo typical tv soap series in all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying well that s not what i expected but as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no there s nothing to congratulate rated r oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again 
this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian we grow good wine our writers and poets are among the world s best the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world but we make bloody awful movies this one isn t especially bad it s especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz lets see what this button on the camera does photography if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation couldn t he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation and if the movie was shot in vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building part of the plot why in god s name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle not only am i mad about this film i m embarassed and more than a little ashamed the australians turn out some splendid stuff we produce pretentious second rate piffle gawd 
taped this late night movie when i was in grade watched it on fast forward i sugest you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early s social activest type films glad i missed that era 
once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h beam piper who wrote a classic book named little fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet mr piper died in but hollywood and many of today s authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of little fuzzy i can wonder why i m the only who s ever noticed but don t take my word for it here s a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of little fuzzy for free http www gutenberg org ebooks 
skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply isn t a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled disorganised movie an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and that s just not the right idea we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn t do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless 
the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine all i can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film as far as i could tell borgnine was the only actor in it the other performances were so uniformly terrible i am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid focused networks but honestly that is not saying much 
honestly where can i begin this was a low budget horribly acted film it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes weren t even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was the sawtooth island movie i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etc was a bunch of garbage that i don t even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it but if you happen to stumble upon this movie do not get it 
over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids i ve developed a sixth sense for spotting the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife prehysteria was head and shoulders above this arrgh 
i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don t get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke opium and have sex not that those aren t good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don t trust the back of the box 
you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab the sister i keep thinking watch out she s a vamp for those that know buffy angel a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don t know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn t make back any money i d say it s good for little kids in it s simplicity but i don t know if i d want to subject a kid to it umm because that s the lowest it will go 
while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer s the odyssey my beef basically is that i couldn t relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn t find myself saying ack i would have done the same thing it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don t get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical 
i know it s a power rangers gimmick and catered to year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie if they are going to write a plot with crayons at least have the decency to make it silly it s kind of hilarious if you watch this we have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space funny stuff however the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight but then they realize none of them know how to probably because no room in budget for choreographers so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in lol rating because they try to treat this seriously 
this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didn t convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i don t like boxing at all it s barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other up nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as cus d amato i don t know how reliable the flick is i haven t read books and books about boxing or tyson i don t know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it s charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough 
a very ordinary made for tv product tyson attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans 
tyson aspect ratio sound format stereo reverent though scrupulously fair account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a warts and all portrait of his rise to fame the pressures of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad constrained by time limits the script gallops through a succession of relevant details alighting briefly on significant events culminating with tyson s temporary downfall in novices will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel s straight arrow approach to the material he portrays tyson s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success in fact the script reserves most of its venom for tyson s ex wife robin givens characterising her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c scott plays tyson s mentor cus d amato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king 
as far as spaghetti westerns go i d put this man can t die on the dull side of the genre it s not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i ve seen guy madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn t particularly good the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven t seen before there s just not much to get very excited about the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she s the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than minutes note the imdb page for this man can t die is wrong rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead she is the character melin i m not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb s credits for the movie 
second tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western which having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine though featuring a nice enough score the plot offers some mild interest the title incidentally refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a ranch the property of the family of their pursuer cavalry agent madison the latter s younger siblings are determined that the injured party now in their charge lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise and both ironically become involved with one of madison s sisters another is raped during the raid euro cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess and madison s ex flame 
this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none also no real suspense washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast the story simply falls a little flat even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact you don t really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare there is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships carter but this seems forced it s an ok film but instantly forgettable 
fairly good movie but not a true story rubin hurricane carter was a notorius liar a murder and was never found not guilty new jersey state just didn t go for it a third time as years had gone carter got an offer in pass a lie test and go free he didn t take it this film should never have been made but money talks a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white why choose a fake story jens
a dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept 
this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old msg and to see this movie was very disappointing i have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and boring there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song 
denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first minutes that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before so first it confuses you and then it puts you off the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers granted it does that so if you are looking for that knock yourself out 
when i saw this movie i heard all the hype and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent i was wrong i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community if they are not african americans themselves i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the semi spoiler hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece denzel washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever i was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good the audience is supposed to leave believing this man rubin carter is a saint people left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more people felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn t it after all it is his point of view i do not like movies especially hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true this was his point of view and a hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people if you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully denzel s acting is stale and the supporting cast s mickey mouse attitudes are annoying the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring 
if this movie was about a fictional character the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively unfortunately for the viewer the movie is based on facts that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter many of the smaller facts were disregarded carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of racist judges is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to giardello why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me ruben carter was never by viewing his actions in the s and even now when he refuses to speak to his son a person that people can look up to everyone knows that jewison can direct and washington can act but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself now thats inspirational based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie i would suggest passing on this one 
this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with saw it years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about romance everything else history if that it s what i call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter s character flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn t have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry discipline in the french army was often rather fierce in short another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment 
probably the worst film i ve ever seen the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep the only good actor was colm meaney i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing 
i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean shaven kerrigan s first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i d ever seen but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some johns and not others the filmmaker doesn t seem to know it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasn t the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary after the screening i saw kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned rhetoric i think it was a cop out i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches 
this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and that s the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures they read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing one and half stars 
like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said someone should beat those two kids up the picture on the cover the chase as it were total fabrication which i guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film it s like michael moore s roger me but if roger me was moore mocking the people of flint it s completely misdirected and totally inane wow can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food what jerks and it s not so much look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn t just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should ve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck that s not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people you should be very proud how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say haha no such house exists your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media morgan please like me spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it s no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him avoid like the plague 
the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isn t really saying what it thinks it s saying in an audacious i hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater vit klusak and filip remunda two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards radio and tv spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a makeshift fa ade to convince people that the store itself actually existed one might well ask why do such a thing well that s a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn t all that satisfying a one essentially we re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that s not true simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse but in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that they re stupid and gullible because they don t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world no i m afraid this smart alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that s been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor i m not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position i m not saying that the movie isn t gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed 
this is almost certainly the worst western i ve ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films hero learns that family friends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge foils the ineffective lawman rescues the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been successful otherwise it wouldn t be a formula but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you ll ever see the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth maturity and realism the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just facades the acting is pitiful sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris lybbert who plays hopalong check out his duds if you dare to watch this film he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working down and dirty cowboy if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy then get this but if you have more than two neurons watch something else 
i have this film out of the library right now and i haven t finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although she d pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film it s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadow who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffany s twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure don t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburn s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann margret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesn t take it seriously at all couldn t be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many ways and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomson s oft used phrase losing his her talent never has made more sense ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have films with gazarra and hepburn who could ask for anything less sandra dee s last pitiful film lost from years later a low budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by audrey hepburn s accent just sounded silly she d go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculous to think that breakfast at tiffany s was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuff corny witless and stifling i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn s singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffany s and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation a great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nun s story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the s and s who became a truly bad one that s not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburn s miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill 
loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can i say it was a total mess the directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast forward slow mo nonsense it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson smashing pumpkins placebo music video whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi s death was just stupidly funny it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up
